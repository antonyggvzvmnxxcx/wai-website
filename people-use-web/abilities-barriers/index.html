<h2 id="diversity">Diversity of abilities</h2>

<p>There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of
auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For
instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or
accident, or they may develop impairments with age. Some may not
consider themselves to have disabilities even if they do experience such
functional limitations.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-diversity-of-abilities">More about diversity of abilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, tools,
preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. For
instance, consider the following aspects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong id="ageing">Age-related impairments:</strong> Many people develop
age-related impairments. While they share the same functional
requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are
significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the
level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general.</li>
      <li><strong id="combined">Multiple disabilities:</strong> Some people have
combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit
their approaches for interacting with the Web. For example, someone
who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for
audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color.</li>
      <li><strong id="health">Health conditions:</strong> Some people have health conditions
that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For
instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that
could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit
the duration or extent of their use of the Web.</li>
      <li><strong id="changing">Changing abilities:</strong> Some people may be experiencing
progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their
use of the Web differently at different times. For example, some
may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or
none on another day, depending on their condition.</li>
      <li><strong id="temporary">Temporary impairments:</strong> Some people may be
experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due
to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about
accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility
features, and may be unaware of their needs.</li>
      <li><strong id="situational">Situational limitations:</strong> Some people may be
experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other
situational aspects. For example, they may be in a loud environment
and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a
screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of
abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities. It
is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional
needs rather than to categorize people according to medical
classifications.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<h2 id="auditory">Auditory</h2>

<p>Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or
both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing
loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities
can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech,
especially when there is background noise. This can include people using
hearing aids.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-auditory-disabilities">More about auditory disabilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with
auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not
designed to be accessible. For example, while video content can be used
to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have
alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible
for people with auditory disabilities.</p>

    <p>To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely
on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only
content and audio tracks in multimedia;</li>
      <li>Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust
the text size and colors of captions;</li>
      <li>Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content
(independently of the system volume);</li>
      <li>High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from
any background noise.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary
language, and they may not read the written language as fluently.
Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text
that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help
make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is
important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities
know sign language.</p>

<h2 id="cognitive">Cognitive, learning, and neurological</h2>

<p>Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve
neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and
mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may
affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear,
move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and
neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of
a person.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-cognitive-learning-and-neurological-disabilities">More about cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Computer technologies and the Web provide many opportunities for people
with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities to interact with
content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them.
For example, people can navigate web content using different
strategies, access information in text, audio, or other formats, and
change the presentation of the content according to their individual
needs or preferences.</p>

    <p>Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and
neurological disabilities often rely on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and
orientation;</li>
      <li>Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts;</li>
      <li>Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction;</li>
      <li>Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and
search;</li>
      <li>Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise
distracting content;</li>
      <li>Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other
illustrations;</li>
    </ul>

    <p>People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use
different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular
needs. For example, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the
information while reading it visually or use captions to read the
information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and
spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and
spelling tools to support writing. For these web browsing methods to
work, developers need to consider web accessibility requirements which
are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual
disabilities.</p>

<h2 id="physical">Physical</h2>

<p>Physical disabilities (sometimes called “motor disabilities”) include
weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary
movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis),
limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that
impedes movement, and missing limbs.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-physical-disabilities">More about physical disabilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized
hardware and software such as:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse;</li>
      <li>Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing;</li>
      <li>On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing
devices;</li>
      <li>Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other
movements;</li>
      <li>Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free
interaction.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>People with physical disabilities may be using a mouse or mouse-like
device only, or keyboard or keyboard-like device only to operate the
computer. People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to
activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to
type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single
keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes
(“chording”) to activate commands. Such keystrokes include commands for
special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items.</p>

    <p>People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas
and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing
large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error
correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other
important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the
current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page
headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual
disabilities share many of these requirements.</p>

<h2 id="speech">Speech</h2>

<p>Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is
recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example,
the loudness or clarity of someone’s voice might be difficult to
understand.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-speech-disabilities">More about speech disabilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>People with speech disabilities encounter barriers with voice-based
services, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that
are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice,
people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction
such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and
keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that
provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an
organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities.
Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms.</p>

<h2 id="visual">Visual</h2>

<p>Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or
both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in
both eyes (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity
to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to
bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness
can be independent of the visual acuity.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h3 id="more-about-visual-disabilities">More about visual disabilities</h3>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>People with visual disabilities typically rely on changing the
presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their
particular needs. For example by:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Enlarging or reducing text size and images;</li>
      <li>Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing;</li>
      <li>Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content;</li>
      <li>Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia;</li>
      <li>Reading text using refreshable Braille.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that
the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying
structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be
processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive
technologies. For example, some people do not see the content and rely
on lists, headings, tables, and other page structures to be properly
coded so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive
technologies.</p>

    <p>Some people are only seeing small portions of the content at a time or
are perceiving the colors and design differently. Some people are using
customized fonts, colors, and spacing to make the content more readable,
or they are navigating through the content using keyboard only because
they cannot see the mouse pointer. An accessible design supports
different presentations of the web content and different ways of
interaction.</p>
