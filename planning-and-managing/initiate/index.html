    <h2 id="learn-the-basics">Learn the basics</h2>

    <p>Find out what accessibility is and why it is important.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more
effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your organization.
Deepening your understanding of web accessibility helps you to address
issues more effectively. Some sources for learning the basics include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Research introductory articles and videos</li>
      <li>Talk with colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities</li>
      <li>Find training appropriate for your particular role</li>
      <li>Seek information or training from accessibility and disability
organizations</li>
      <li>Set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them
out</li>
    </ul>

    <p>First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content
is often enlightening and inspiring. This can help you and others to
understand the benefits and value of accessibility.</p>

    <h3 id="what-is-web-accessibility">What is web accessibility?</h3>

    <p>Web accessibility fulfills the basic promise of the web - making
information and communication readily available to all people regardless
of barriers in geography, language, or disability. Integrating
accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations and
other website visitors. For example, easier code maintenance and better
user experiences, particularly on mobile devices.</p>

    <p>Learn the organization’s current state of accessibility and obligations
to help determine the scope of work ahead.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Explore and learn the current state of accessibility in your
organization to help when initiating discussions with stakeholders, such
as management. Several aspects of web accessibility can be checked
fairly easily, with little or no technical skills required. This
includes cursory checks of:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Key websites and website user activities</li>
      <li>Web content policies and processes, such as those related to editing
and publishing</li>
      <li>General awareness of and attitude towards accessibility and
disability</li>
      <li>Understanding of accessibility law and policy as they effect your
organization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may not be in the position to explore all these aspects in a first
attempt. However, the more information you can gather, the better you
will understand the types and sources of the issues that need to be
addressed.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h2 id="set-objectives">Set objectives</h2>

    <p>Clear objectives identify key deliverables, establish a timeline, and
define how to measure success.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Create objectives in response to identified accessibility problems and
organizational goals. Develop measurable objectives that address
accessibility gaps within the organization’s web content, processes, and
policies. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities
need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that
successful delivery can be determined.</p>

    <p>Ensure that objectives have management agreement and support. This will
help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business
objectives, and reinforce your strategy. Also ensure that objectives
help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks,
production workflows, or quality assurance processes.</p>

    <p>Examples of objectives might include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Develop accessibility policy by year-end.</li>
      <li>Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and
enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end.</li>
      <li>Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA
non-conformancies within 18 months.</li>
      <li>Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content
authors by May.</li>
      <li>Modify design approval process to include accessibility
considerations before June.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="develop-business-case">Develop business case</h2>

    <p>A strong business case helps gain buy-in from stakeholders and can make
accessibility an organizational priority.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Develop a tailored business case to respond to why accessibility should
be addressed within your organization. The business case will be used to
persuade stakeholders and management that web accessibility should be
financially supported and prioritized.</p>

    <p>Depending on organizational priorities, the business case should
explore:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Direct impact for users with disabilities</li>
      <li>Broader benefits for everyone, such as usability</li>
      <li>Financial, time, and resource costs associated with not addressing
accessibility early</li>
      <li>Legal aspects that may be applicable to your organization</li>
      <li>Impact on corporate social responsibility</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The business case should also outline the risks associated with ignoring
accessibility, provide some indication of the resources needed, and
specify how improvements will be tracked, and anticipated return on
investment.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h2 id="raise-awareness">Raise awareness</h2>

    <p>Communicate the goals, value-adds, and importance of accessibility
throughout the organization.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Lack of awareness is a frequent reason for lack of accessibility
adoption. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility.
Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website
accessibility. Others may not be aware of the additional value that
accessibility brings. A general introduction to accessibility, including
organizational goals, will benefit everyone in the organization by
improving awareness and building enthusiasm for the task.</p>

    <p>Consider audience needs and interests as you raise awareness of the
benefits of web accessibility. Management will need to know about risk,
budget, policy, and return on investment but designers may engage with
understanding and solving the design challenges of accessibility.
Developers may also enjoy the challenge of making modern designs
accessible using new skills in HTML5, JavaScript, and ARIA. Marketing
may be interested in user stories and demonstrating corporate
responsibility.</p>

    <p>Consider inviting guest or expert speakers to organizational or
departmental events to talk about accessibility.</p>

<details><summary>

    <h2 id="gather-support">Gather support</h2>

    <p>Organization-wide support is vital to ensure accessibility is
distributed across the organization and sustained.</p>

  </summary>
  <div>

    <p>Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of
introducing or improving accessibility. Management support will help
with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication
activities. Use the business case to help secure support from these
groups.</p>

    <p>Support for accessibility is often found among other project teams
involved in the creation of websites. Encourage interest in these groups
by exploring how accessibility has broad benefits. For example,
individuals can improve their skills, organizations improve their
websites, and people with disabilities have a better online experience.
This will help increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more
advocates or champions.</p>

    <p>Create opportunities to exchange information and provide support. This
could be informal between interested individuals, such as chat channels
and lunch gatherings, or more formal presentations to management during
staff meetings or feedback sessions.</p>
