    "title": "Instructions for Commenting on WCAG 2 Documents",
    "text": "Summary This page tells you how you can comment on WCAG 2 documents and submit Techniques. Page Contents Introduction How to Comment Submitting Techniques For more info Introduction Please read this page for important information about commenting on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2. Note that comments on WCAG 2 cannot impact the standard since it is no longer in development, although we will still take them into consideration as described below. WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are stable Web Standards that will not change. Your comments on WCAG 2 maybe be used for an errata (documenting errors), for updating Understanding WCAG 2 and Techniques for WCAG 2, or for informing the next generation of accessibility standards and guidelines. Understanding WCAG2 and Techniques for WCAG 2 will be updated periodically. Your comments will help inform the updates. Before commenting, please read WCAG introductory and education material, including: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview The WCAG 2.0 Documents How to Comment There are multiple ways to provide comments on WCAG 2.0 and related documents: Github pull request Online Form Email comment submission GitHub pull request The source XML documents for WCAG 2.0 and related documents are available on GitHub . Commenters familiar with GitHub can fork the WCAG 2.0 repository , clone that to their local machine, edit the source files, and submit a well-commented pull request as a way to provide comments and edits to the working group for review. If you later decide to make another pull request, first sync your fork to be sure your edits will be based on the the latest content. The WCAG 2.0 sources page includes basic information about the files contained in the GitHub repository to help commenters understand which files to edit. Suggestions for comments submitted via GitHub pull requests: Provide a complete summary and description for each pull request. The Working Group needs to understand the rationale for proposed changes. This description may need to be very detailed in some cases, such as if proposing to remove a technique; or may be quite brief, for example if providing a change to address a spelling issue. Keep pull requests specific to individual comments. Some comments may require changes to multiple source files, for example if an external link is incorrect in multiple files, and this is appropriate if the changes all relate to the same comment. However, if several separate comments are submitted together within a single pull request not only is it more difficult for the working group to parse the different points made in the comment but unless the group agrees with all aspects of the comment the pull request may need to be rejected. In this case, the accepted parts of the comment will be added separately, but utilizing the commenter’s contribution is more difficult. If the commenter does not know what edits need to be made, comments and relevant details can be shared with the working group by creating an issue in GitHub. When a pull request is accepted by the Working Group, an editor will integrate changes into the working branch. When it is time to publish the complete document as a refreshed document (about every six months) then the working branch will be merged into the master branch. Pull requests and issues that are accepted by the working group will be merged into the source documents and the commenter will receive a notification from GitHub that the pull request was accepted and an email indicating this will also be sent to the public WCAG comments email list. Online Form Please use online comment form to comment on: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) How to Meet WCAG (Quickref) Understanding WCAG 2.0 Techniques for WCAG 2.0 (For WCAG 2.0 documents not in the list above, send comments to wai-eo-editors@w3.org, a publicly archived list.)

    "title": "W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 Conformance Logos",
    "text": "Summary This page provides information about conformance logos for WCAG 2. Note: The information is for WCAG 2.0. It will be updated for WCAG 2.1 later in 2018.This page includes logos for 2.0 and for 2.1. Page Contents How to use the logos Logos Scope of the claim Responsibility for accuracy of claims Comments To further promote accessibility on the Web, W3C provides conformance logos for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. Content providers can use these logos on their sites to indicate a claim of conformance to a specified conformance level of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. Note that this does not represent review or validation of conformance by W3C and/or WAI. We expect that use of these logos on conformant sites will help raise awareness of accessibility issues. Conformance to WCAG 2.0 is defined in the Conformance section of the specification. Here is the excerpt that defines the conformance levels: Conformance Level “A”: all Level A success criteria are satisfied; Conformance Level “AA”: all Level A and AA success criteria are satisfied; Conformance Level “AAA”: all Level A, AA, and AAA success criteria are satisfied; Please refer to WCAG 2.0 for more information about information required in a conformance claim. How to use the logos Place the icon for the appropriate conformance level using the HTML source code below: Level A Conformance Level AA Conformance Level AAA Conformance Level A Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: &lt;a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2A-Conformance\" title=\"Explanation of WCAG 2.0 Level A Conformance\"&gt; &lt;img height=\"32\" width=\"88\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag2A\" alt=\"Level A conformance, W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; If you would like to use the blue logo, append “-blue” to the image src. Level AA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: &lt;a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance\" title=\"Explanation of WCAG 2.0 Level Double-A Conformance\"&gt; &lt;img height=\"32\" width=\"88\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag2AA\" alt=\"Level Double-A conformance, W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; If you would like to use the blue logo, append “-blue” to the image src. Level AAA Conformance Put the following HTML markup in your page: &lt;a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AAA-Conformance\" title=\"Explanation of WCAG 2.0 Level Triple-A Conformance\"&gt; &lt;img height=\"32\" width=\"88\" src=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag2AAA\" alt=\"Level Triple-A conformance, W3C WAI Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt; If you would like to use the blue logo, append “-blue” to the image src. Logos Below are the logos as they will appear in your site. You may also choose to download and use local copies of the logos, using the links provided for each logo. You will have to adjust the HTML accordingly, but please use the same alternative text and link for the logo. WCAG 2.0 Logos &nbsp; A AA AAA Gold (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) Blue (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) WCAG 2.1 Logos &nbsp; A AA AAA Gold (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) Blue (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) (png, gif, svg, eps) Scope of the claim By default, a conformance icon refers to a single page. If the claim is meant to apply to include more than one page, the conformance icon must be accompanied by explicit scope information explaining which pages are covered by the claim. Responsibility for accuracy of claims Content providers are solely responsible for the use of these logos. Before using these logos as part of a conformance claim, we recommend that the provider be familiar with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 and use a variety of review methods to ensure that any page using this logo meets the conformance level claimed. Providers should also ensure that anyone maintaining or updating the site is familiar with logo use, and either re-reviews the page or removes the logo from the page if they are unsure whether it still meets a specified conformance level. Please note that use of this logo is not conditional on an automated test. There is as yet no tool that can perform a completely automatic assessment on the checkpoints in the guidelines, and fully automatic testing may remain difficult or impossible. It is also possible for automated accessibility checkers to register “false negatives” or “false positives” due to the type of mark-up on a page. For these reasons, the logos on this page are used to indicate only a claim of conformance made by the author of a page, not a machine-validated conformance. In spite of these issues with machine testing, it is an important component of ensuring that a site conforms to WCAG 2.0, as long as it is not the only component.

    "text": "Summary This page describes the different Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 technical documents. It helps you know where to go for which type of information. For background and an introduction to WCAG, see Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview. Page Contents Different documents for different purposes WCAG 2 Standard How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) Understanding WCAG 2 Techniques for WCAG 2 Getting from one document to the other Additional Resources Different documents for different purposes Figure 1: WCAG 2.0 documents. WCAG 2.1 has the same documents. WCAG 2 Standard Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is designed to be a stable, referenceable technical standard. Most people will use the supporting documents when developing web content and web tools, instead of the actual technical standards document. How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference): A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques is a key resource for designers and developers using WCAG 2. It includes all the WCAG 2 guidelines and success criteria. It is essentially the WCAG 2 checklist . The success criteria are the testable statements that define how web content meets (conforms to) WCAG 2. Under each success criteria are a list of sufficient techniques; that is, if you implement those techniques you meet the success criteria. It also lists common failures, that is, things that do not meet the guidelines. You can customize How to Meet WCAG 2 to show what you are interested in at the time. There are “filters” for different roles, topics, and technologies (such as HTML, CSS, ARIA). You can also select to show Level A, AA, or AAA success criteria . Understanding WCAG 2 “Understanding WCAG 2: A guide to understanding and implementing Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2” (2.1 Understanding , 2.0 Understanding ) has additional details for people who want to understand the guidelines and success criteria more thoroughly. It provide extensive guidance, including the intent of the guideline or success criterion; how it helps people with different disabilities, browser and assistive technology support notes, examples, and resources, such as tools to check color contrast . Techniques for WCAG 2 “Techniques for WCAG 2: Techniques and Failures for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2” (2.1 Techniques , 2.0 Techniques ) gives specific guidance for developers on how to develop accessible web content. It provides general and technology-specific examples, including for HTML/XHTML, CSS, scripting, multimedia, and WAI-ARIA. There are also common failures that show what to avoid. Getting from one document to the other The WCAG 2 documents are interlinked. For example: In WCAG 2, Links such as “How to Meet 1.1.1” go to the How to Meet WCAG 2 document, and jumps down to that section within the document. Links such as “Understanding 1.1.1” links go to an Understanding WCAG 2 topic page. You can get to the Contents list of all the Understanding topics from the [Contents] button at the top. You can get all the topics in one large web page from the “single HTML version” link in the footer of each topic page.

    "title": "Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Introduction This page helps you start to assess the accessibility of a web page. With these simple steps, you can get an idea whether or not accessibility is addressed in even the most basic way. Scope These checks cover just a few accessibility issues and are designed to be quick and easy, rather than definitive. A web page could seem to pass these checks, yet still have significant accessibility barriers. More robust assessment is needed to evaluate accessibility comprehensively. This page provides checks for the following specific aspects of a web page. It also provides guidance on Next Steps and links to more evaluation resources. Page Contents Page title Image text alternatives (\"alt text\") (pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.) Text: Headings Contrast ratio (\"color contrast\") Resize Text Interaction: Keyboard access and visual focus Forms, labels, and errors (including Search fields) General: Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content Multimedia (video, audio) alternatives Basic Structure Check Using these Easy Checks Click headings with [+] buttons to get hidden information Some sections of this page might not apply to your situation, for example, they are for a browser you don't have, or you only need to read them once. These sections are hidden by default so they don't clutter the page. You can expand them to see the information. The headings of hidden sections have a plus button [+] before them. Screen readers will say something like: &quot;graphic, expand this section&quot;. To get the hidden information, click the button or click anywhere on the heading. The sections below all have hidden information under expandable headings. The first time you read this page, we recommend that you expand the headings of these five sections and read them. Tools: WebDev Toolbar and IE WAT (optional) You can do most of these checks with any browser, that is, you do not need to download special tools. However, some checks are easier if you can download tools. To keep it simple, we&#39;ve included instructions for just two tools: the Web Developer Toolbar for Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (&quot;WebDev Toolbar&quot;) and the Web Accessibility Toolbar for Internet Explorer (&quot;IE WAT&quot;). Both are free extensions/add-ons available in different languages. WebDev Toolbar - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with the WebDev Toolbar&quot;, you&#39;ll need either the Chrome browser and the Web Developer extension for Chrome the Opera browser and the Web Developer extension for Opera the Firefox browser and the Web Developer extension/add-on for Firefox IE WAT - To do the checks that are indicated &quot;with IE WAT&quot;, you&#39;ll need the Internet Explorer (IE) browser version 9 or later and the Web Accessibility Toolbar version 19 July 2013 or later. Note that we&#39;re not endorsing these tools over others. There are many other useful tools to help with evaluation. (If you can&#39;t download these tools, that&#39;s OK; you can still do the checks indicated &quot;with any browser&quot;.) WCAG links These checks are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. The main points in WCAG are called &quot;Success Criteria&quot;. In the &quot;Learn more from&quot; sections of this page, there are links to pages that explain the relevant success criteria in the &quot;Understanding WCAG 2.0&quot; document. Please see the WCAG Overview for an introduction to WCAG. Practicing with BAD, the Before-After Demo The Before and After Demonstration (BAD) from W3C WAI shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of this same website with the accessibility barriers fixed. You can use the BAD pages to learn how to do these checks. For example, first, do the check on an accessible version of a page to see what it should look like. Then, do the check on the corresponding inaccessible page to see what it looks like when there are accessibility barriers. The BAD pages have annotations that are notes on what is accessible and not accessible in the demo pages. To turn on annotations, click &quot;Show Annotations&quot; in the yellow box near the top, middle of the page; then click a number and a box titled &quot;Note ##&quot; will open with the explanation. Background These checks are designed for anyone who can use the web. You don&#39;t need much knowledge or skill. Some of the checks require seeing the web page or hearing the audio. However, there are many things that anyone can check. Here are some things to know that will help you understand the brief explanations throughout this page: markup refers to web page code, called HTML. You can see the markup of a web page in most browsers by selecting from the menu: View &gt; Source. You do not need to look at the markup to do these checks; however, it does help to understand what &quot;markup&quot; and &quot;marked up&quot; means. assistive technologies (AT) are software or hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. screen readers are software that reads aloud the information in web pages and enables keyboard navigation. They are used by people who are blind. voice input is using speech instead of a keyboard and mouse. To learn more, see: Introduction to Web Accessibility Accessibility Principles Keyboard instructions: Ctrl for Windows, cmd for Mac Some of the keyboard instructions are different for Windows and Mac; for example, &quot;Ctrl&quot; versus &quot;cmd&quot; in: For Windows: With the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. For Mac: With the keyboard: cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. To reduce clutter, these are listed as: With the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. For such instructions, Windows users press the Ctrl key, and Mac users press the cmd key. Page title Page titles are: shown in the window title bar in some browsers shown in browsers' tabs when there are multiple web pages open shown in search engine results used for browser bookmarks/favorites read by screen readers (In the web page markup they are the &lt;title&gt; within the &lt;head&gt;.) The image below shows the page title &quot;Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility&quot; in the title bar, and the titles of 4 pages in the tabs. Note that in the tabs, only the first part of the page title is shown. Figure: Firefox browser with full title in the title bar and partial titles in the tabs. Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — to help people know where they are and move between pages open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say when the user goes to a different web page is the page title. What to do: Look at the page&#39;s title (or with a screen reader, listen to it). Look at titles of other pages within the website. What to check for: Check that there is a title that adequately and briefly describes the content of the page. Check that the title is different from other pages on the website, and adequately distinguishes the page from other web pages. Tips There is flexibility on what makes a good page title. Best practice is for titles to be &quot;front-loaded&quot; with the important and unique identifying information first. For example: Poor titles: Welcome to home page of Acme Web Solutions, Inc. Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | About Us Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | Contact Us Acme Web Solutions, Inc. | History Better page titles: Acme Web Solutions home page About Acme Web Solutions Contact Acme Web Solutions History of Acme Web Solutions &lt;/div&gt; Page title checks To check page title with different browsers If you have a browser that displays the page title in the window title bar by default, use that browser. Some versions of Firefox, Safari, Opera, and older versions of IE show the title by default. Firefox on Windows: If the title bar isn't displayed you might be able to display it by pressing: Alt+V, T, M (or right-mouse click in the empty area after the tab and select Menu Bar). If your browser doesn't have a title bar, you can do try one of these: With your mouse, hover over the browser tab to see the full page title, like this: Figure: Page title in popup, displayed with mouse hover over tab. Display the Add Bookmark dialog box, which includes the title. In some Windows browsers, press Ctrl+D. In some Mac browsers, press cmd+D to get the Add Bookmark dialog box. To check page title with IE WAT (Some versions of IE have the title bar so you can just look there, you don't need to do the steps below.) Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;Heading structure&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. A new page opens. The page title is shown after &quot;Title:&quot;. Learn more about page titles Page Titled - Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.2 for WCAG 2.0 (Level A) Image text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;) Text alternatives (&quot;alt text&quot;) convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc. Text alternatives are used by people who do not see the image. (For example, people who are blind and use screen readers can hear the alt text read out; and people who have turned off images to speed download or save bandwidth can see the alt text.) The text should be functional and provide an equivalent user experience, not necessarily describe the image. (For example, appropriate text alternative for a search button would be &quot;search&quot;, not &quot;magnifying glass&quot;.) You don&#39;t usually see the alt text on a web page, it is in the web page markup (like this: &lt;img src=&quot;pointer_to_image.png&quot; alt=&quot;here's where the alternative text goes&quot;&gt;). Every image should include alt in the markup. If an image conveys information useful for interacting with or understanding the web page content, then it needs alternative text. If an image is just decorative and people don&#39;t need to know about the image, then it should have null alt (alt=&quot;&quot;). Automated tests can tell you if alt is missing. To determine if the alternative text is appropriate, you need to see the image and judge it in context. What to check for: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text. Tips Appropriate alternative text is not an exact science. Some people prefer most images to have more detailed description; and others prefer much less description. Appropriate alt text: The text needs to convey the same meaning as the image. That is, if someone cannot see the image, they get the important information from the image in the alternative text. Alternative text depends on context. For example, for an image of a dog on a kennel club website, the alt text might include the breed of the dog; however, the same image on a dog park website may be there just to make the page more attractive, and the image might not need any alt text (and should have null alt). One way to help think about appropriate alt text is: if you were helping someone read and interact with the web page and they cannot see it, what would you say about the image? Images that are functional — for example, images that initiate actions (like submit buttons) and linked images (like in navigation) — need alt text that is the functional equivalent. If there is text in the image — for example, in a logo — that text needs to be included in the alt text. If the image has complex information — such as charts or graphs — the image should have a short alt text to identify the image, and then the detailed description of the information should be provided elsewhere (for example, in a data table). What is not needed in the alt text: If the image is not important for understanding the content — for example, it is just decoration or &quot;eye candy&quot; — it should have null alt (alt=&quot;&quot;). One way to help determine if an image should have null alt is to ask yourself: If the image was removed, would the user still get all the information from the page? The alternative text does not need to include the words &quot;button&quot;, &quot;link&quot;, or &quot;image of&quot;. (Screen readers automatically provide that information.) If the image is sufficiently described in the text — for example, a simple diagram illustrating what&#39;s written in the web page text — it can have brief alt text such as &quot;Diagram of work flow as describe above.&quot; alt attribute in HTML (not &quot;alt tag&quot;) In HTML (which is web page code, called markup), alt is an attribute of the image element, and other elements. (So &quot;alt tag&quot; is technically incorrect; the correct terminology is &quot;alt attribute&quot;, or you can say &quot;alt text&quot;.) It looks like this in markup: &lt;img alt=&quot;WAI logo&quot; src=&quot;/wai/logo.png&quot;&gt; Alt text checks There are three options to check alt text listed below. The first one is the easiest, if you have the IE WAT toolbar. If you don&#39;t have any toolbars, there is a check at the end for any browser. To check alt text with IE WAT Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Show Images&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+4, then arrow down to &quot;Show Images&quot; Figure: IE WAT toolbar with 'Images' drop down and 'Show Images' highlighted. If there are any images missing alt, a dialog box appears with the number of images without alt attributes. The alt text will be displayed before the images in quotes on a light background. To check for missing alt: Look for the text &quot;NoAlt!&quot; (visually, or with find-in-page). If you find it, that means the following image is missing alt. To check if alt text is appropriate: For each image, see if the alt text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. To check alt text with WebDev toolbar Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Outline Images&quot;, then &quot;Outline Images Without Alt Attributes&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, O, A Red boxes appear around any images missing alt. Figure: WebDev toolbar menu, and red boxes around images. Note images without any alt text. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Display Alt Attributes&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, A The alt text will be displayed before the images as white letters on a red background. Figure: WebDev toolbar menu, and alt text displayed. For each image, see if the alt text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. To check alt text with any browser Open WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool web page. Type the website address in the box after &quot;Enter the URL of the web site you want to evaluate:&quot; Click the &quot;WAVE this page!&quot; button. Your web page will show up in the browser with lots of little icons on it. To check for missing alt: Look for the red alt icon (), or search for the alt text &quot;ERROR: Missing alt text&quot;. If you find it, that means the following image is missing alt. To check if alt text is appropriate: Look for the green alt icon (). Next to it is text on a light blue background; the alt text is in between the asterisks (*). See if that text adequately conveys the information in the image it is next to, per the Tips above. Figure: WAVE showing alt text. To practice checking alt text in BAD With one of the checks above, use the inaccessible home page www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/home Notice: Missing alt: There are lots of images without alt text. (Many of these are just decorative and should have null alt text, per the Tips above.) The weather image of the cloud and sun is missing alt. Inappropriate alt text: Near the top, left, see the long alt text starting with &quot;Red dot with...&quot;. That description is way too detailed and includes unimportant information. The appropriate alt text in the accessible page is: &quot;Citylights: your access to the city.&quot; Near the bottom in the middle, see the image of text: &quot;(1)269C-H-O-K-E&quot;. The alt is 123456789, which is not equivalent. Appropriate alt text: Near the top, see the W3C image; the alt text is: &quot;W3C logo&quot;. Learn more about alt text Text alternatives for non-text content is an easy introduction with links to more details Non-text Content - Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 for WCAG 2.0 (Level A) An alt text decision tree Headings Web pages often have sections of information separated by visual headings, for example, heading text is bigger and bold (like &quot;Headings&quot; right above this sentence :-). To make these work for everyone, the headings need to be marked up. That way people can navigate to the headings — including people who cannot use a mouse and use only the keyboard, and people who use a screen reader. Heading levels should have a meaningful hierarchy, e.g.: Heading Level 1 &lt;h1&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; Heading Level 3 &lt;h3&gt; Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt; Heading Level 4 &lt;h4&gt; Heading Level 2 &lt;h2&gt; What to check for: The page has a heading. In almost all pages there should be at least one heading. All text that looks like a heading is marked up as a heading. All text that is marked up as a heading is really a conceptual section heading. The heading hierarchy is meaningful. Ideally the page starts with an &quot;h1&quot; — which is usually similar to the page title — and does not skip levels; however, these are not absolute requirements. Headings checks The checks below provide instructions with different browsers for how to get an outline from headings or headings markup in a page. Headings outline: an outline of the headings that are marked up on page, for example: Figure: Outline of headings. Headings markup in page: a view of the page with the heading markup shown, for example: Figure: Heading markup in page. To check headings with WebDev toolbar Headings outline: Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Information&quot;, then &quot;View Document Outline&quot;.Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, M A new page opens with the outline. Non-visual checks: Are headings listed. If there are no headings marked up, it will say &quot;0 headings&quot;. Does the outline start with [H1] and follow a meaningful hierarchy? (That&#39;s not required, but strongly suggested.) Visual checks: Compare the Document Outline to the visual rendering of the page. Are the things that look like headings on the page listed in the Document Outline? Are there things in the Document Outline that aren&#39;t really headings? Heading markup in the page: Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Outline&quot;, then &quot;Show Element Tags Names When Outlining&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), O, S In the toolbar, select &quot;Outline&quot;, then &quot;Outline Headings&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), O, H The headings will be outlined and &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc. icons will be before the headings. Anything that is a functional heading should have a heading icon before it. Anything that is a not functional heading should not have a heading icon before it. To check headings with IE WAT Headings outline: Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;Heading Structure&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow to &quot;Heading structure&quot;. A new page opens with the outline. Non-visual checks: Are headings listed? If there are no headings marked up, it will say &quot;0 headings&quot;. Does the outline start with [H1] and follow a meaningful hierarchy? (That&#39;s not required, but strongly suggested.) Visual checks: Compare the Document Outline to the visual rendering of the page. Are the things that look like headings on the page listed in the Document Outline? Are there things in the Document Outline that aren&#39;t really headings? Heading markup in the page: Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;Headings&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+6, then down arrow to &quot;Headings&quot;. Headings will be surrounded with &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, etc. icons in purple text on a light background. Anything that is a functional heading should have a heading icon before it. Anything that is a not functional heading should not have a heading icon before it. To check headings in any browser Headings outline: In any browser, open the W3C HTML Validator (The W3C Markup Validation Service). In the Address field, type the URI (e.g., www.w3.org). Click the More Options link. Select the Outline checkbox. Click the Check button. The results page appears (with title starting either [Valid] or [Invalid]). In the results page, near the top, at the end of the &quot;Jump to:&quot; line, click the Outline text link. Non-visual checks: Is there anything there? If there is no text between &quot;Below is an outline for this document, automatically generated from the heading tags (&lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;.)&quot; and &quot;If this does not look like a real outline...&quot; it means there are no headings marked up on the page. Does the outline start with [H1] and follow a meaningful hierarchy? (That&#39;s not required, but strongly suggested.) Visual checks: Compare the Document Outline to the visual rendering of the page. Are the things that look like headings on the page listed in the Document Outline? Are there things in the Document Outline that aren&#39;t really headings? Heading markup in the page: Open WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool. Type the website address in the box after &quot;Enter the URL of the web site you want to evaluate:&quot; Click the &quot;WAVE this page!&quot; button. Your web page will show up in the browser with lots of little icons on it. Anything that is a functional heading should have a heading icon (, , , etc.) before it. Anything that is a not functional heading should not have a heading icon before it. To practice checking headings in BAD: Headings outline: Follow one of the instructions under &quot;Headings outline&quot; above and use the accessible News page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/news. Notice there is a nice hierarchical outline. Next, use the inaccessible News page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/news. (In HTML Validator, the &quot;Check&quot; button might now say &quot;Revalidate&quot;.) Notice there is just one heading. Heading markup in the page: Start by visually looking at the inaccessible BAD news page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/news. What looks like headings? (Citylights News, Heat wave linked to temperatures, Man Gets Nine Months in Violin Case, ...) Next, see how it should look. Follow one of the instructions for &quot;Heading markup in the page&quot; above on the accessible News page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/home. Notice the headings have icons next to them. Next, see what it looks like when headings are not marked up. Use the inaccessible News page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/home. Notice there is text that visually looks like headings, but does not have headings icons next to it. (With WAVE, there are yellow icons with &quot;h?&quot; because it thinks these might be headings.)

Figure: Gray text on light background. High contrast (for example, dark text on light background or bright text on dark background) is required by some people with visual impairments, including many older people who lose contrast sensitivity from ageing. Figure: Dark text on light background, and yellow text on black background. While some people need high contrast, for others &mdash; including some people with reading disabilities such as dyslexia &mdash; bright colors (high luminance) are not readable. They need low luminance. Figure: Brown text on dark background, and dark text on medium brown background. Web browsers should allow people to change the color of text and background, and web pages need to work when people change colors. (This accessibility requirement is sometimes called sufficient &quot;color contrast&quot;; however, that is incorrect &mdash; technically it's &quot;luminance contrast&quot;. On this page we use &quot;contrast ratio&quot; as short for &quot;luminance contrast ratio&quot; because it's less jargony.) There is much more to know about contrast; we&#39;ve just introduced the basics here. What to check for: Web pages should also have a minimum contrast by default: a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal-size text. There are basically three ways to check contrast, each with strengths and weaknesses. Table with contrast ratio - The tool displays a table with all the possible contrast ratios in the web page. With some tools, you can click in the table and it will show where that color combination is in the web page. Pro: Comprehensive. Con: Can be inaccurate, specifically, it can show some color combinations that are not really in the displayed page. Eye-dropper to select colors - The tool lets you select a text color and a background color, then it shows you the contrast ratio. Pro: Accurate. Con: Can only test one item at a time. Need to be able to see and use a mouse. Turn off color. The tool shows the page in grayscale. Pro: Gives you direct experience. Con: Imprecise, does not provide contrast ratio value. Contrast checks Below are instructions for checking contrast with IE WAT; a list of other contrast analyzer tools is in the Related Resources section of Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3. To check contrast with IE WAT Here's how to do the three checks for sufficient contrast described above. Table with contrast ratio: In the toolbar, select Color &gt; Juicy Studio Luminosity Analyser. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl/cmd+Alt+5, then down arrow to &quot;Juicy Studio Luminosity Analyser&quot;. A new window opens titled Colour Contrast Analyser with the table of results. The last column is Luminosity Contrast Ratio. Eye-dropper to select colors: In the toolbar, select: Color &gt; Contrast Analyser [application]. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+5, then down arrow to &quot;Contrast Analyser [application]&quot;. The Color Contrast Analyser application window opens. Using the first eye-dropper icon from the foreground color section, pick the foreground color (usually the text) you want to analyze. Using the second eye-dropper icon from the background color section, pick the corresponding background color. In the bottom of the Color Contrast Analyser window, the resulting luminosity Contrast ratio will show (for example: 7.5:1), along with &quot;Pass&quot; or &quot;Fail&quot; and a visual example of the colors. Turn off color: In the toolbar, select Color &gt; Grey Scale. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+5, then down arrow to &quot;Gray Scale&quot;. Check if any information is lost or hard to see when all colors are converted to grayscale. Checking contrast with other browsers There is not an easy way to check contrast with the WebDev toolbar. There is a Juicy Studio Accessibility Toolbar add-on that provides the same information as IE WAT above and works with Firefox. To practice checking contrast with BAD Open the inaccessible Tickets page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/tickets Use one of the checks above. Notice: The text in some rows is dark gray on light gray with a contrast ratio of 3.76:1. Learn more about contrast ratio Contrast (Minimum) - Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3 for WCAG 2.0 (Level AA) Contrast (Enhanced) - Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.6 for WCAG 2.0 (Level AAA) Resize text Some people need to enlarge web content in order to read it. Some need to change other aspects of text display: font, space between lines, and more. Most browsers allow users to change text size through: text size settings (usually through Options or Preferences) text-only zoom page zoom (which also zooms images, buttons, etc.) When pages are not designed properly, they can be unusable when the text size is changed, especially when it is changed through text-only zoom or text settings. Sometimes columns and sections overlap, the space between lines disappears, lines of text become too long, or text disappears. Figure: Two screen captures show that when text size is increased, the heading overlaps the main text, the main text overlaps the sidebar text; and the sidebar text is cut off at the bottom. When text size is increased, sometimes part of the sentences are not visible and users have to scroll horizontally to read a sentence, as shown in the third example below. Most people cannot effectively read text that requires horizontal scrolling, and some disabilities make this impossible. Figure: The first image shows normal-size text. In the second image, the larger text &quot;wraps&quot; to fit the width. In the third image, some of the larger text is not visible without scrolling horizontally. What to do: Increase the text size. What to check for: All text gets larger. (A common problem is that text is not provided as actual text format but instead the text is in an image. Text in images does not get larger when users increase text size.) Text doesn't disappear or get cut off. Text, images, and other content do not overlap. All buttons, form fields, and other controls are visible and usable. Horizontal scrolling is not required to read sentences or &quot;blocks of text&quot;. It is best practice that when text size is increased, all the text in a sentence is visible. It is acceptable to have to scroll horizontally to get to different sections of a page. (For top-to-bottom languages, change &quot;horizontal scrolling&quot; to &quot;vertical scrolling&quot;.) Resize text checks The instructions below are for text-only zoom. You can also change the text size settings, for example, through Tools &gt; Options or Preferences. To keep this simple, we don't include instructions for changing those settings. We also don't include instructions for page zoom because it does not usually reveal the accessibility barriers described above. For Chrome, you need an extention to get text-only zoom. Instructions for Firefox, Safari, and IE are below. To check text-only zoom in Firefox Set zoom to text only. From the menubar, select View &gt; Zoom &gt; Zoom Text Only. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+V, Z, T Increase zoom to 200%. To incrementally increase zoom with the keyboard: Windows, press Ctrl+[+] (hold down the control key and press the + key at the same time). On Mac, press command+[+] (hold down the command key and the + key at the same time). Usually 4-6 key presses gets to 200%. To check or set the zoom percent from the menu option: Click the menu button. In the customization menu, click the + button to zoom larger. The number before the + button is the current zoom percent. To confirm that you have text-only zoom set from step 1, make sure that only the text is getting larger, not the images. To check text-only zoom in Safari Increase zoom to 200%. From the menubar, select the View Menu, hold the option key, and select Make Text Bigger. Or, with the keyboard on Mac, press option+command+[+] (hold down the option key, the command key, and the + key at the same time). Usually 4-6 key presses gets to 200%. Confirm that only the text is getting larger, not the images. To check text resize in IE From the menubar, select View &gt; Text Size &gt; Largest. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+V, X, G. If you don't have a menubar, one of these may work to display it, depending on your version: In the search box, type Internet Explorer, then in the list of results, click Internet Explorer. To display the menus temporarily: Press the Alt key. To display the menus permanently: Click the Tools button, point to Toolbars, and then click Menu Bar. In the blank space at the top of the browser where menu bars usually are, right-click with the mouse. A pop-up menu appears. Select Menu bar.

People who are blind and some sighted people with mobility impairments rely on the keyboard or on assistive technologies and strategies that rely on keyboard commands, such as voice input. Accessible websites enable people to access all content and functionality &mdash; links, forms, media controls, etc. &mdash; through a keyboard. Keyboard focus should be visible and should follow a logical order through the page elements. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight, as shown below, that moves as you tab through the web page. Figure: Dotted border on middle link. Figure: Name field is highlighted red. What to do: In a browser that supports keyboard navigation with the Tab key (for example, Firefox, IE, Chrome, and Safari; not Opera): In Mac browsers, enable keyboard navigation to all controls. In newer browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts. Select the &quot;All controls&quot; option button. In older browsers: Select System Preferences &gt; Keyboard &gt; Keyboard Shortcuts. In the &quot;Full Keyboard Access&quot; section, check &quot;All Controls&quot;. Click in the address bar, then put your mouse aside and do not use it. Press the 'Tab' key to move through the elements on the page. You can press 'Shift-Tab' to go backwards. To move within elements such as drop-down lists and menu bars, press the arrow keys. To select a specific item within a drop-down list: Tab to the list box, use the arrow keys to move the focus to items, when an item has focus, press the Enter key or Space bar to select that item. What to check for: Tab to all: Check that you can tab to all the elements, including links, form fields, buttons, and media player controls. (A common problem is that you cannot tab to media player controls.) Tab away: Check that you can tab away from all elements that you can tab into. (A common problem is the keyboard focus gets caught in media controls and you cannot get out; it's called the &quot;keyboard trap&quot;.) Tab order: Check that the tab order follows the logical reading order (e.g., for left-to-right languages: top to bottom, left to right) in sequence. Visual focus: Check that the focus is clearly visible as you tab through the elements, that is, you can tell which element has focus, e.g., links have a gray outline around them or are highlighted. All functionality by keyboard: Check that you can do everything with the keyboard; that is, you don't need the mouse to activate actions, options, visible changes, and other functionality. (A common problem is that some functionality is available only with mouse hover, and is not available with keyboard focus.) Drop-down lists: Check that after you tab into a drop-down list, you can use the arrow keys to move through all the options without triggering an action. (A common problem for drop-downs used for navigation is that as soon as you arrow down, it automatically selects the first item in the list and goes to a new page &mdash; you cannot get to other items in the list.) Image links: Check that when images are links, they have clear visual focus and can be activated using the keyboard (usually by pressing the Enter key). To see visual focus with BAD Open the accessible Survey page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey Tab through the page. Notice: Most things get a red background when they get focus. The other Survey pages get a dotted border and arrows. The radio buttons get a dotted border.

If it's too complicated, consider skipping it for now and proceeding through the remaining checks. Labels, keyboard access, clear instructions, and effective error handling are important for forms accessibility. Form fields and other form controls usually have visible labels, such as &quot;E-mail Address:&quot; as the label for a text field. When these labels are marked up correctly, people can interact with them using only the keyboard, using voice input, and using screen readers. Also, the label itself becomes clickable, increasing the target area and making it easier to select small radio buttons or checkboxes. What to do: Find any forms on the page. A form could be a single text box, such as Search, or could be a complex form with text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, drop-down lists, and buttons. What to check for: Keyboard access Check that all form controls are keyboard accessible by following the keyboard access checks above, including checking that you can get to all items in any drop-down lists. Labels Check that every form control has a label associated with it using 'label', 'for', and 'id', as shown in the labels checks below. (This is best practice in most cases, though not a requirement because a form control label can be associated in other ways.) Check that the labels are positioned correctly. For left-to-right languages, labels should usually be: Left of text boxes and drop-down lists. Right of radio buttons and checkboxes. Required fields and other instructions Check that any fields that are required/mandatory are clearly indicated. Check that the indicator does not rely on color alone, for example, if required fields were only indicated by red colored labels, they would not be accessible to people who do not see the different colors. Check that the indicator (such as asterisks (*)) is included in the marked up field label for text boxes and drop-down lists, or legend for radio buttons and checkboxes, as shown in the labels checks below. Check that any instructions for completing the form are before they are needed, for example, General instructions should usually be at the top of the form or the section they relate to. Check that required formats, such as dates (year-month-date in the format 0000-00-00), are included in the marked up label, using the labels checks below. Error handling Some simple forms, such as a single search field, might not have any errors. If you think the form(s) on the page you are checking might have error messages, try leaving required fields blank or entering incorrectly-formatted information (such as telephone number or e-mail address), then submitting the form. If you get errors: Check that clear and specific guidance is provided to help people understand and fix the error. If the error concerns a format such as date, time, or address, check that the correct format is clearly explained. Check that the errors are easily findable. Generally it is best if the error messages are before the form, rather than after the form. Check that the fields without errors are still populated with the data you entered. (This is best practice, though not a requirement.) People should not have to re-enter all the information in the form, except for some sensitive data such as credit card numbers. Labels checks Note: These instructions help you check if labels are marked up with 'label', 'for', and 'id'; they do not check if form controls are identified in other ways. Therefore, even if a form does not pass these checks, it might still meet WCAG 2.0. To check labels with IE WAT Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Structure&quot;, then &quot;FieldSet / Labels&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+6, then down arrow key to &quot;FieldSet / Labels&quot;, and select. A dialog box appears with the number of errors and controls. Figure: IE WAT dialog box. The dialog box tells you the number of identified errors, the total number of form controls, and the number of controls that you need to check manually. For the rest of the steps you need to look at the text around the labels. If this is difficult, you could skip the next steps. The form elements (labels and controls) are outlined in a red box, the markup is shown, and potential errors are indicated. Example with no errors: Figure: Form markup shown. Date label includes format. Example with potential errors: Figure: Form markup shown. Date label does not include format. Fieldset missing legend. Check that every field label has label for=&quot;x&quot; before it and id=&quot;x&quot; in the box with it, and that the text in quotes matches. (&quot;x&quot; can be anything; for example, for=&quot;park&quot;, id=&quot;park&quot;) If the label is missing, it will indicate &quot;Label no for&quot;. If the for and id do not match, it will indicate &quot;input No Match id=&quot;x&quot; Error&quot;. Check that the required field indicator is in the field label, or for radio button and check boxes, it is in the &quot;legend&quot;. For example: Correct: The asterisk (*) is included in the box around the label. Incorrect: The asterisk (*) is outside of the box around the label. Correct: &quot;(required)&quot; is in the legend. Incorrect: &quot;(required)&quot; is not in the legend. Checking labels with other browsers There is not an easy way to check form control labels with the WebDev toolbar. There is a Form Labels favelet that provides the same information as IE WAT above and works with Firefox. It requires installation. To check labels if you're comfortable looking at the HTML markup Open the source HTML and find the form markup. Check that: Each form control has a label element with a for attribute that matches the value of the id attribute in the related control. For example: &lt;label for=&quot;firstname&quot;&gt;First name: &lt;/label&gt; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;firstname&quot; id=&quot;firstname&quot; /&gt; Each id is unique within the web page. To practice checking form labels and errors with BAD Labels: Open the Accessible Survey Page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey that has several forms. Do the label checks above. Notice the 'label's, 'for's, and 'id's. Open the Inaccessible Survey Page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/survey and do the label checks above. In IE WAT, you get the dialog box saying there are errors and the errors are marked in the page with &quot;&lt;input Error&gt;&quot;. Errors: Open the Accessible Survey Page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/survey. Leave the fields blank and Submit the form. Notice the error messages at the top and the asterisks to indicate required fields. Also, the page title includes &quot;Submission Failed&quot;. Open the Inaccessible Survey Page: www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/survey. Leave the fields blank and Submit the form. Notice errors are only indicated by the label being red, and there is no explanation of the errors.

Users need to be able to control moving content, especially some people with attention deficit disorder or visual processing disorders. Potential accessibility problems with moving, flashing, or blinking content include: Understanding moving information — Some people read and process information slowly. The content may disappear before people have time to read it. Some people have difficulty tracking moving objects. Distraction from moving content — Moving content can make focusing and reading elsewhere difficult; that is, people cannot focus on some content because the movement in another area of the web page grabs their attention. Additionally, flashing or blinking content can cause seizures in people with photosensitive epilepsy, particularly if it: flashes more than three times in one second, covers a large enough area of the screen, and is bright enough. What to check for: Check if there is any moving, blinking, or scrolling information that starts automatically and lasts more than five seconds. If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the movement. Check if there is any auto-updated information (such as stock price). If there is, check that there is a way for the user to pause, stop, or hide the updated information, or for the user to control the frequency of the update. Check that no content flashes or blinks more than three times in one second. If it does, further evaluation is needed as explained in Three Flashes or Below Threshold.

Visual information in videos is not available to people who are blind or some people what have low vision, unless it is provided in an alternative format such as audio or text. (Text can be read by a screen reader or Braille display, or enlarged and reformatted for people with low vision.) (Remember these easy checks are not comprehensive or definitive.) What to check for: Keyboard access Follow the steps above for keyboard access to ensure that the media player controls are labeled and keyboard accessible. Auto-start control It is best if audio (including background noise and video with sound) does not start automatically when a web page opens. If it does start automatically, it should either: Stop after 3 seconds. Include controls to pause or stop the audio. Include controls to turn down the volume. Captions (Captions are known as &quot;subtitles&quot; in some areas.) Most video on the web that provides captions has &quot;closed captions&quot; that can be turned on and off. (&quot;Open captions&quot; are always shown.) For example, in YouTube, you turn on captions with the CC button (no known keyboard access). If there is not a CC button, there are no captions available for that video. Automatic captions are not sufficient for accessibility because they are not accurate enough. For example, in YouTube, if only &quot;automatic captions&quot; are listed, there are no sufficient captions and the video is not accessible. Captions in the specific language need to be listed. Figure: Captions listed: French (automatic captions), Norwegian. If there are captions, you can check that: The captions seem in sync with the spoken content. The people who are speaking are identified when they speak. Important sound other than dialogue &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking &mdash; is included. Transcript It is best practice to provide both captions and transcripts, although not always required; providing transcripts has many benefits &mdash; both to people with disabilities and to website owners. Transcripts should be easy to find near the audio/video itself and any links to the audio/video. Check that transcripts include all audio information, including dialogue with the speakers identified, and all important sound &mdash; e.g., footsteps approaching, doors closing, glass breaking. A transcript for a video could provide all the audio and all the visual information, so that a person can get all the content of the video by reading the text. Audio description Audio description (sometimes known as described video, video description, or visual interpretation) is description of important visual information in a video, in order to make it accessible to people who cannot see. For example, some videos start out with a title in text, have speaker names in text, and have illustrations. That visual information needs to be provided to people who cannot see the video. It can be provided through: Audio description - where the audio track includes someone describing the important visuals. Audio description can be included in the main video, or it can be provided in a separate video. Text transcript - that includes description of meaningful visual information (so it's kind of like a screenplay).

It helps you understand how some people &quot;see&quot; the web page differently. For this basic structure check, you look at the web page without images, styles, and layout. Web pages are often designed with multiple columns, sections, colors, and other visual aspects that help organize information for people who see the page in its default display. However, some people do not see the page this way. People who are blind listen to the page with a screen reader or read it from a Braille display. Some people with low vision and others change the way the page is displayed so they can read it; for example, change from multiple columns to one column, change the text size, and more. An important issue is how the web page works when it is &quot;linearized&quot; into one column and the presentation is changed, as shown in the images below. Images showing linearized and changed display (click to show images) The images below illustrate how a web page is displayed in 3 columns by default and how it can be changed. Figure A shows the default display of three columns, with the navigation at the left. Figure A. Figure B shows the page linearized into one column, with the navigation at the top. Figure C shows the page linearized, with the navigation at the bottom. The order of the sections (e.g., navigation at top or bottom or elsewhere) depends on how the web page is developed &mdash; the user usually cannot control the order. Figure B. Figure C. Figure D shows the page linearized and with styles turned off. When you follow the Basic structure checks steps below, your page will look like something like this: Figure D. Figure E shows the page changed by a person with low vision to make it more readable, for example, the main text is big, the footer text is very small, and the headings are a different color. Figure E. While it is useful to have an experienced screen reader user check web pages, anyone can get an initial idea of potential accessibility barriers for screen reader users and others who change the way the page is presented. The steps below show you how to disable images, disable styles for how the page is usually displayed, and linearize the page to check the page structure. Notes: Data tables will not make sense when linearized &mdash; that's OK because screen readers have functionality to make data tables usable (when they are marked up correctly). BAD provides a clear example of how the basic structure check reveals accessibility barriers. (It's also a bit funny, and we suggest you check it out, by following the BAD instructions below.) What to do: Get a basic structure view of the page by following the instructions under Basic structure checks below to: Turn off images and show the text alternatives. Turn off style sheets (CSS), which specifies how the page is displayed with layout, colors, etc. Linearize the page or the tables (depending on the toolbar). What to check for: Check that the information makes sense when read in the order it is shown; for example, headings are right above the information they apply to. (Data tables do not need to make sense linearized, per the note above.) Check that the alternative text provides adequate information for the missing images (per the Image text alternatives section above). Check that blocks of information have clear headings (see also the Headings section above). When navigation, main content, and other sections have good headings, it's easier for people to find their way around the information. Basic structure checks To check basic structure with IE WAT Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Remove Images&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+4, then arrow down to &quot;Remove Images&quot;. In the toolbar, select &quot;CSS&quot;, then &quot;Disable CSS&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+3, then arrow down to &quot;Disable CSS&quot;. In the toolbar, select &quot;Tables&quot;, then &quot;Linearize&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Ctrl+Alt+7, then arrow down to &quot;Linearize&quot;. To check basic structure with WebDev toolbar Open the web page you are checking. In the toolbar, select &quot;Images&quot;, then &quot;Disable Images&quot;, then &quot;Disable All Images&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), I, D, D. In the toolbar, select &quot;CSS&quot;, then &quot;Disable Styles&quot;, then &quot;Disable All Styles&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), S, D, D. In the toolbar, select &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;, then &quot;Linearize Page&quot;. Or, with the keyboard: Alt+T, W (to Web Developer Extension), M, I. To check basic structure with any browser Most browsers provide the option to turn off images and disable CSS from the menus. For example: In Opera: View &gt; Images &gt; Show Images or, Alt+V, I, S View &gt; Style &gt; User Mode or, Alt+V, S, U In Safari: If the Develop menu is not shown in the menu bar, turn it on: In Safari preferences, click Advanced. Select the &quot;Show Develop menu in menu bar&quot; checkbox. Develop &gt; Disable Images or, Ctrl+F2, D, down arrow to Disable Images Develop &gt; Disable Styles or, Ctrl+F2, D, down arrow to Disable Styles To practice checking basic structure with BAD First use the Accessible Home Page www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/after/home with one of the checks above to turn off images, disable CSS, and linearize. Skim down and notice that under &quot;Welcome to CityLights&quot; there are 3 article headlines with summary text under each headline. Next use the Inaccessible Home Page www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/home with one of the checks above to turn off images, disable CSS, and linearize. Skim down to find &quot;Welcome to CityLights&quot;. Notice that it's much harder to find. That's because it's not marked up as a heading, per above. Notice that the 3 article headings are together and the article text is together. (For fun, read the article text together.) To check a form, use the Inaccessible Survey Page www.w3.org/WAI/demos/bad/before/survey (This example is easier to see with IE WAT.) Look at how the radio buttons are laid out. Then linearize. Notice that that radio button labels are not with the buttons. (This is because the page uses layout tables incorrectly.) Next steps Now that you have an idea of the accessibility issues on a web page, two things you can do: Share your findings with someone who can fix accessibility barriers. Encourage thorough accessibility evaluation. Share your findings Contacting Organizations about Inaccessible Websites has guidance on reporting accessibility problems. It is focused for people who do not work for the organization that owns the website, yet also has some useful information if you do work for the organization &mdash; particularly the Introduction, Consider Your Approach, and Sources for More Information sections. Encourage thorough accessibility evaluation The checks on this page are not definitive; a web page could seem to pass these checks, yet still have significant accessibility barriers. This page covers just a few accessibility issues. There are other accessibility issues not covered in these easy checks, for example: links, data table markup, reliance on color, and much more. More robust assessment is needed to evaluate accessibility comprehensively.

    "title": "WCAG 2 FAQ",
    "text": "Summary This page answers to some frequently asked questions (FAQ) about Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Let us know what other questions you have. ~Shawn Henry , W3C WAI, updated 22 June 2018 Page Contents Is WCAG 2 stable? What about WCAG 2.1? What's next after WCAG 2.1? Does VPAT 2.1 include WCAG 2.1? Does WCAG address mobile accessibility? Where should I start? What are the different WCAG 2 documents? Do content authors (developers, designers, etc.) have to follow W3C's techniques to meet WCAG? What would be the negative consequences of allowing only W3C's published techniques to be used for conformance to WCAG 2? Is ISO/IEC 40500 the same as WCAG 2.0? Is WCAG 2 available in other languages? Can I meet WCAG 2 with Javascript/Ajax, Silverlight, and other technologies? Where can I find answers to more of my questions? Is WCAG 2 stable? Yes. WCAG standards (called &quot;W3C Recommendations&quot;) are a stable, referenceable standards that do not change. There may be later versions published. WCAG 2.0 was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.1 was published as a final W3C Recommendation Web Standard on 5 June 2018. They will not change. The supporting resources &mdash; Techniques for WCAG 2 and Understanding WCAG 2 &mdash; are updated periodically to reflect updates in technologies and best practices. See also important information in the next answer about WCAG 2.1: What about WCAG 2.1? All requirements (“success criteria”) from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. The primary focus for WCAG 2.1 is additional accessibility requirements for: mobile accessibility people with low vision, people with cognitive and learning disabilities There are 17 additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don’t need to bother looking at 2.0. WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies. What's next after WCAG 2.1? The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is also exploring future accessibility guidelines through the Silver Task Force. Additional information is available in a Silver presentation . This project will take several years. In the interim, the Working Group might decide to develop WCAG 2.2 to provide additional updates to address current accessibility requirements. Does WCAG 2 address mobile accessibility? Yes. See the Mobile Accessibility at W3C page. Does VPAT 2.1 include WCAG 2.1? No. Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT) 2.1 includes information from WCAG 2.0. VPAT 2.1 does not include information from WCAG 2.1. (VPAT is not developed by W3C.) Where should I start? If you want a really short introduction to 3 web accessibility issues (alternative text for images, keyboard input, and transcripts), see Examples of Web Accessibility. To learn about web accessibility principles and guidelines, see Accessibility Principles. To learn about WCAG 2 specifically, start with the WCAG Overview. It provides an important foundation for understanding the different WCAG 2 documents, and points to several resources for using WCAG 2. How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference is the primary resource for developers using WCAG 2. What are the different WCAG 2 documents? To learn how the different WCAG 2 technical documents are related and linked, see The WCAG 2 Documents. Here's a little more perspective on the different technical documents. When web content and web software developers were using WCAG 1.0, they had many questions on how to implement it, how to evaluate for it, and the reasons behind its requirements. WAI wanted to provide this information with WCAG 2, and since those details don't fit well in a technical standard, they are in the supporting documents. Thus with WCAG 2, there are extensive supporting materials, which are advisory documents. The WCAG 2 guidelines document itself is the only document that is a web standard, and it is fairly short. Do content authors (developers, designers, etc.) have to follow W3C's techniques to meet WCAG? No, you do not have to use the techniques in W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2 document. The techniques are informative; that means they are not required. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard — not the techniques. While many authors find W3C-documented techniques useful, there may be other ways to meet WCAG success criteria. You can use other techniques. Web content could even fail a particular technique test, yet still meet WCAG in a different way. Also, content that uses some of the Techniques does not necessarily meet all WCAG success criteria. For important additional information, see the Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria section of Understanding WCAG 2.1. What would be the negative consequences of allowing only W3C's published techniques to be used for conformance to WCAG 2? Background: Some organizations have considered requiring all web content to use W3C's published techniques. W3C recommends that the only thing that is required is meeting the WCAG 2 success criteria. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard — not the techniques. W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2 document is informative (that is, not required, non-normative). W3C cautions against requiring web content to use only W3C's published sufficient techniques and not allowing other techniques for several reasons, including: It would prevent the use of new technologies (for example, HTML5 and WAI-ARIA) while the technologies and relevant sufficient techniques are being developed, which is usually more than a year. It often takes several years for technologies to be developed and finalized. Once a technology is stable, it usually takes several months for the WCAG Working Group to develop techniques, test them with user agents and assistive technologies, make them available for public review, revise them as needed, and formally publish them. W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2 is not comprehensive and may not cover newer technologies and situations. There may be techniques that are sufficient to meet a given success criteria, but that are not yet included in W3C's published document. W3C's published sufficient techniques may not always be the best techniques in a specific circumstance. It is not always possible to use the W3C's published sufficient techniques — for example, because of the way the content is designed — and there are other ways to meet the success criteria. It would prevent the use of new techniques and best practices until W3C published them. Therefore, W3C's published techniques should not be required as the only way to meet WCAG 2 success criteria unless the limitations and consequences above are understood and acceptable. For additional information, see: Understanding Techniques for WCAG Success Criteria section of Understanding WCAG 2.1. Is ISO/IEC 40500 the same as WCAG 2.0? Yes. WCAG 2.0 is approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 is exactly the same as the original Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). The content of ISO/IEC 40500 is freely available from www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20; it is available for purchase from the ISO catalogue . For supporting resources that provide practical advice for meeting ISO/IEC 40500 (which is WCAG 2.0), see the WCAG Overview. The approval was announced 15 October 2012 in a press release and blog post . If you want more information on W3C and the ISO process, see W3C PAS FAQ . Benefits of WCAG as ISO Approval of WCAG 2.0 as an ISO standard benefits countries and organizations that can more easily adopt ISO standards. Countries that previously adapted WCAG 2.0 may now be able to adopt WCAG 2.0 as is by referencing ISO/IEC 40500. Translations W3C has offered our WCAG 2.0 Authorized Translations to be used for the ISO/IEC translations. We will update this page when more information about translations is available. Is WCAG 2 available in other languages? Yes. Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of the technical documents WCAG 2, Techniques for WCAG 2, and Understanding WCAG 2 are listed in WCAG 2 Translations. Unofficial translations of other WAI documents are listed at Translations of W3C Documents - WAI documents - listed by languages and Translations of W3C Documents - WAI documents - listed by document . For more information on how you can contribute to WAI translations, see Translating WAI Documents. Can I meet WCAG 2 with Javascript/Ajax, Silverlight, and other technologies? WCAG 2 is designed to apply to a broad range of web technologies. Techniques for WCAG 2 has techniques for several different web technologies. Note that publication of techniques for a specific technology does not imply that the technology can be used in all cases to create accessible content that meets WCAG 2. Developers need to be aware of the limitations of specific technologies and ensure that they create content in a way that is accessible to all their potential users. WAI is also developing guidance on Applying WCAG 2 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT) . Where can I find answers to more of my questions? First, look through the documents on the W3C WAI website. WAI hosts an Interest Group (WAI IG) mailing list where the community discusses web accessibility issues. WAI IG provides ideas from different perspectives. If you have a question that might be relevant to the WAI IG list, you can: Search the WAI IG list archives to see if your question has already been addressed sufficiently. Join the self-subscription list and post an appropriate question. Please read the Using the WAI IG mailing list section of the WAI IG page. WAI staff are actively developing guidelines, technical reports, and supporting material, and generally are not available to answer individual questions. However, you can send questions to wai@w3.org and we will integrate answers into this page and other documents as we are able.",

Quick links to resources: ATAG at a Glance ATAG 2.0 Recommendation Implementing ATAG 2.0 Page Contents ATAG Who ATAG is for What is in ATAG 2.0 Is ATAG 2.0 a finished standard? ATAG Versions: 1.0 and 2.0 Who develops ATAG ATAG Authoring tools are software and services that “authors” (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content (static web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.). Examples of authoring tools are listed below under “Who ATAG is for”. The Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) documents explain how to: make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and help authors create more accessible web content — specifically: enable, support, and promote the production of content that conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). ATAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Essential Components of Web Accessibility explains the relationship between the different guidelines. Who ATAG is for ATAG is primarily for developers of authoring tools, including the following types of authoring tools: web page authoring tools, for example, what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) HTML editors software for generating websites, for example, content management systems (CMS), courseware tools, content aggregators software that converts to web content technologies, for example, word processors and other office document applications with “Save as HTML” multimedia authoring tools websites that let users add content, such as blogs, wikis, photo sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites other types of tools listed in the glossary definition of authoring tools ATAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others. For example: People who want to choose authoring tools that are accessible and that produce accessible content can use ATAG to evaluate authoring tools. People who want to encourage their existing authoring tool developer to improve accessibility in future versions can refer the authoring tool vendor to ATAG. What is in ATAG 2.0 ATAG 2.0 has two main parts: Part A is about making the authoring tool itself accessible. Part B is about the authoring tool helping authors produce accessible content. ATAG 2.0 is organized in layers: Principles provide high-level organization for the guidelines. Guidelines provide the framework and objectives for the success criteria. Success criteria are the accessibility requirements, which are written as testable statements, at three levels: A, AA, AAA. ATAG at a Glance provides a short summary of the accessibility principles and guidelines in ATAG 2.0. Implementing ATAG 2.0 is a supporting informative document that helps readers understand and use ATAG. Implementing ATAG 2.0 provides the rationale for each guideline; and for each success criterion, it provides the further explanation of the intent of the success criteria, examples, and links to resources. Is ATAG 2.0 a finished standard? ATAG 2.0 is a W3C Recommendation. This means that ATAG 2.0 is a completed standard, having received public comments, completed implementation testing, demonstrated real world examples of products that are using ATAG 2.0 to make their products more accessible, and being approved by the W3C membership. (These stages are explained in How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process.) ATAG Versions: 1.0 and 2.0 Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was approved in February 2000. While ATAG 1.0 is still a valid standard, it is outdated. ATAG 2.0 is the current standard. Who develops ATAG ATAG was developed by the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (ATAG WG), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). For more information about the working group, see the AUWG page. How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute describes formal periods for public review. Opportunities for review and comment of WAI documents are announced on the WAI home page and WAI Interest Group mailing list.

    "text": "Summary This page introduces the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), including WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1. Quick links to resources: How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) WCAG 2.0 Standard WCAG 2.1 Standard Page Contents Introduction WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 Who WCAG is for What is in the WCAG 2 Documents WCAG 2.0 is ISO/IEC 40500 Other guidelines Who develops WCAG More Information Introduction Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 WCAG 2.0 was published on 11 December 2008. WCAG 2.1 was published on 5 June 2018. All requirements (“success criteria”) from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. There are additional success criteria in 2.1 that are not in 2.0. They are introduced in What’s New in WCAG 2.1. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. (This is often called “backwards compatible”.) A website that meets WCAG 2.1 should meet the requirements of policies that reference WCAG 2.0. To put it another way: If you want to meet both WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1, you can use the 2.1 resources and you don’t need to bother looking at 2.0. WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are both existing standards. WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG when developing or updating content or accessibility policies. Who WCAG is for WCAG is primarily intended for: Web content developers (page authors, site designers, etc.) Web authoring tool developers Web accessibility evaluation tool developers Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility Related resources are intended to meet the needs of many different people, including policy makers, managers, researchers, and others. WCAG is a technical standard, not an introduction to accessibility. For introductory material, see Where should I start? in the FAQ. What is in the WCAG 2 Documents WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 are stable, referenceable technical standards. They have 12-13 guidelines that are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. For each guideline, there are testable success criteria, which are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA. For a short summary of the WCAG 2 guidelines, see WCAG 2 at a Glance. To learn about web accessibility principles and guidelines, see Accessibility Principles. The WCAG 2 supporting technical materials include: How to Meet WCAG 2: A customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2 requirements (success criteria) and techniques is essentially the WCAG 2 checklist . Most people use this quick references as the main resource for working with WCAG. Techniques for WCAG 2 (2.1 Techniques , 2.0 Techniques ) gives you specific details on how to develop accessible web content, such as HTML code examples. The techniques are “informative”, that is, you do not have to use them. The basis for determining conformance to WCAG 2 is the success criteria from the WCAG 2 standard, not the techniques. Read more in Techniques in the FAQ . Understanding WCAG 2 (2.1 Understanding , 2.0 Understanding ) has additional guidance on learning and implementing WCAG 2 for people who want to understand the guidelines and success criteria more thoroughly. For more details on how these document are related and how they are linked, see The WCAG 2 Documents. Translations Authorized Translations and unofficial translations of WCAG 2 are listed in WCAG 2 Translations. Technical document format The WCAG, Techniques, and Understanding documents follow the W3C format for technical reports, which has several sections at the beginning, including links to different versions, editors, abstract, and status. Supplemental guidance Supplemental guidance provides additional information beyond what is required in WCAG 2.0 and 2.1. It addresses improving accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities and people with low vision. Links to supplemental guidance will be added to this section in the future. WCAG 2.0 is ISO/IEC 40500 WCAG 2.0 is approved as an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500:2012. ISO/IEC 40500 is exactly the same as the original WCAG 2.0, which is introduced above along with supporting resources. The content of ISO/IEC 40500 is freely available from www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20 ; it is available for purchase from the ISO catalogue . Benefits of WCAG 2.0 as an ISO standard are summarized in ISO in the FAQ. More information on W3C and the ISO process is in the W3C PAS FAQ .

    "title": "The Business Case for Digital Accessibility",
    "text": "Summary This article examines the rationale for organizations to address accessibility. It includes tangible and intangible benefits, and the risks of not addressing accessibility adequately. It explores how accessibility can: Drive Innovation: Accessibility features in products and services often solve unanticipated problems. Enhance Your Brand: Diversity and inclusion efforts so important to business success are accelerated with a clear, well-integrated accessibility commitment. Extend Market Reach: The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the online experience for all users. Minimize Legal Risk: Many countries have laws requiring digital accessibility, and the issue is of increased legal concern. Note that “web accessibility” and “websites” throughout this article include web and mobile applications and other digital technologies. Page Contents Is there a Business Case for Accessibility? Accessibility is good for business Drive Innovation Enhance Your Brand Increase Market Reach Minimize Legal Risk Share your experience Conclusion Resources Is there a Business Case for Accessibility? A business case is a necessary tool for organizations when planning for various initiatives. Whether an organization is commercial, educational, non-profit, or governmental, most require justification for dedicating resources such as money or effort in support of a specific organizational policy or goal. “Business” in this article refers to all types of organizations with the understanding that different aspects will be relevant depending on the organizational focus and purpose. For example, government agencies may be strongly motivated by legal and equity aspects. Commercial businesses may be more persuaded by innovation and market expansion opportunities. Educational and nonprofit businesses may be especially drawn to brand enhancement. To create a compelling business case, it is important to highlight the most relevant accessibility benefits within your specific operational landscape. There are both tangible and intangible benefits to businesses that dedicate resources to digital accessibility. A frequent argument against the accessibility business case is that the direct return on investment (ROI) is too difficult to measure. ROI is important of course, but not by any means the only way to measure how an accessibility commitment benefits organizations of all kinds. A useful business case also presents the cost and risk of inaction. It is most likely your business will respond to a mix of motivating factors as you consider implementing an integrated accessibility program. This article provides research and examples to inspire confidence among leaders and decision makers that continued investment in accessibility is good for your business. Businesses that integrate accessibility are more likely to be innovative, inclusive enterprises that reach more people with positive brand messaging that meets emerging global legal requirements. A research study of Fortune 100 companies indicates that disability inclusion, as part of an overall diversity strategy, is common practice among high performing businesses.1 When accessibility is part of strategic planning, businesses are better equipped for success in our connected world of commerce, academia, and civic engagement. Let’s look at some examples and research outcomes that will help you make the business case that is most effective in your business environment. Accessibility is good for business Many organisations are waking up to the fact that embracing accessibility leads to multiple benefits – reducing legal risks, strengthening brand presence, improving customer experience and colleague productivity. Paul Smyth, Head of Digital Accessibility, Barclays The sections below explore key advantages of web accessibility to businesses of all types. Real world examples are presented to show how benefits are realized in the global marketplace. Drive Innovation Integrating accessibility removes architectural, digital, and social barriers that can get in the way of innovation2, for example: Accessible design thinking provides varied and flexible ways for users to interact with websites and applications, options that are useful for people with and without disabilities. Design of user interaction considers experiences other than screens when accessibility is a consideration. The result is interaction that is more human-centered, natural, and contextual. Accessibility is closely related to general usability – both aim to define and deliver a more intuitive user experience. Innovations like the typewriter, telephone, punch cards, text to speech, email, and voice controls were initially meant to include those with a disability, and all have found a much broader application.3 Driverless cars, so promising for the independence of blind people, are projected to also help solve traffic fatalities and congestion. Research and development of the artificial retina project to help restore sight for participants who are blind may also help future robots with real-time image-processing systems, effectively enabling them to “see.” 4 Accessible design is by its nature flexible, allowing content to faithfully render across a broad spectrum of devices, platforms, assistive technologies, and operating systems. In physical environments, everyone takes advantage of lower curbs, automatic door openers, ramps, and other features provided for disability access. On the web, accessibility features become options that are also often used more widely. A compelling example comes from the early 2000’s, when people increasingly used mobile devices to browse the web. Accessible and standards-compliant websites were in many cases more mobile-ready as they did not rely on mouse input. Imagine the delight of those who were already committed to and had designed for accessibility! This revelation led to the responsive-design trend that has accessibility at its core.5 The following case studies from two large technology companies provide useful examples for companies of all sizes. Case Study: Apple Accessibility is a core value at Apple and something we view as a basic human right. Sarah Herrlinger, Director of Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives, Apple Apple engineers have been innovators in the accessibility space since the inception of the company, both willing to listen and work with outside constituents. 6 The company also anticipates market direction by integrating disability needs into product development. Examples include: iTunes U: In the early 2000’s, the 26-campus California State University system was unable to take advantage of Apple’s iTunes U educational program because the application was not fully accessible to blind students. Teachers within the CSU system were prohibited from using it. This was resolved by innovation, not litigation, as Apple listened to CSU’s concerns and worked to make iTunes accessible on both the Mac and Windows platforms. CSU System was soon able to use the program widely. VoiceOver on iPhone: Early in the evolution of the iPhone, Apple began considering the implications that a touchscreen device would have on their blind customers. Iterating over several years behind the scenes, the company invested the resources to develop the voice technology that led to VoiceOver, the world’s first gesture-based screen reader. Within weeks of launch, Apple received a special commendation from the National Federation of the Blind “For designing the first fully accessible touchscreen interface.” 7 Screen readers on other touch screen devices have now become more prevalent in the industry and Apple has shown important leadership in the effort to ensure inclusion for all. Innovation from voice interactions at Apple and elsewhere have contributed to the abundance of personal digital assistants now found in many homes and offices. Today millions of people use these devices, regardless of ability. Case Study: Google The accessibility problems of today are the mainstream breakthroughs of tomorrow. Eve Andersson, Director, Accessibility Engineering, Google A 2016 article in the FastCompany online magazine8 highlights how Google’s investment in accessibility provides the company with an innovation edge in a broad array of products and services. Eve Andersson, the lead engineer, featured in the article, says “I’m passionate about accessibility, not just because I believe in a level playing field, but because (it) makes life more livable for everyone.” Among the innovations cited as examples are these: contrast minimums, required for people with low vision, help all people see in bright light glare situations auto-complete, initially provided for people with disabilities, is now widely used by all voice control, implemented for users with physical impairments, has been more widely adopted as a great convenience by millions of others artificial intelligence advances are based on research originally done to provide visual context to users with visual impairments auto-captioning using machine learning has been problematic for the main target population of deaf users and many feel it is still inadequate to meet that need. However, work continues and machine learning itself is steadily improving and has found broader applications due to this effort. Enhance Your Brand Businesses need to protect and enhance their brands. A clear commitment to accessibility can demonstrate that a business has a genuine sense of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). As businesses understand and act on the diverse needs of their stakeholders and make the commitment to sustainable, inclusive marketing and employment practices, they can achieve a range of benefits. Potential outcomes for CSR programs include enhanced brand image and reputation, increased sales and customer loyalty, improved workforce diversity and many other benefits.9 Further studies10 emphasize the benefits to the brand of companies that institute policies of broad diversity. Employing people with disabilities is an essential aspect of creating a diverse workforce. To be successful, the technology that employees use, including websites and applications, must be accessible. Barclays shared their approach to diversity and inclusion through the accessibility initiatives in their company and how that approach has made them a better company. Case Study: Barclays Establishing an organisation-wide accessibility strategy for identifying, anticipating and addressing the additional needs of customers and colleagues with impairments contributes in several ways to our brand identity – through tailored services, fostering an inclusive culture, creating new ways to communicate and consult with existing and potential customers. At Barclays, accessibility is about more than just disability. It's about helping everyone to work, bank and live their lives regardless of their age, situation, abilities or circumstances.Paul Smyth, Head of Digital Accessibility, Barclays We want to leverage inclusive technology to enable and empower all people to bank, work and reach their full potential. The Barclays Accessibility team does this by supporting digital teams to embed accessibility into our services and culture through effective governance, partnering, training, and tools. Establishing an enterprise-wide accessibility strategy, standards and programmes coupled with senior sponsorship helps support our publicly stated ambition of becoming the most accessible and inclusive Financial Times Stock Exchange (FTSE) company. When we shift our thinking away from the minimum legal compliance to focus instead on the commercial opportunity and the creative challenge of building better experiences for everyone, we create a more sustainable, customer orientated approach to digital information and services. To help everyone understand Barclays accessibility-focused mindset, we’ve created a range of animations which help our colleagues understand what accessibility is all about, who benefits, and what the different types of impairments are. We’ve also shared these animations on our Accessible Banking YouTube playlist . Barclays demonstrates how a strong commitment to accessibility results in distributed responsibility and shared understanding. Accessibility awareness permeates the company culture. The company is perceived as open and fair. People are proud to work there and to do business with Barclays. Read the full Barclays case study to learn more. Another well-recognized example of how a brand can be affected is Microsoft. After long advocacy and some criticism by accessibility advocates 11, Microsoft made a real and appreciable commitment to accessibility demonstrated by genuine engagement with stakeholders of all abilities.12 The resulting improvements to products and services have strengthened its overall brand image 13, and accessibility efforts are now lauded in the community of people with disabilities.14 Increase Market Reach The market of people with disabilities is large and growing as the global population ages. In the UK, where the large disability market is known as the Purple Pound, people with disabilities and their families spend at least £249 billion every year. In the US, the annual discretionary spending of people with disabilities is over $200 billion. The global estimate of the disability market is nearly $7 trillion. Consider these facts when estimating market size: At least one billion people – 15% of the world’s population – have a recognized disability15 As the population ages, many more acquire disability and yet do not identify as a “person with a disability”16 In countries with life expectancies of over 70 years of age, people spend 11.5 percent of their lifespan living with a disability.17 Globally, the extended market is estimated at 2.3 billion people who control an incremental $6.9 trillion in annual disposable income.18 A Forrester Research Economic Impact Study commissioned by Microsoft concluded that accessibility could contribute to cost savings when it is integrated into existing and ongoing development cycles. 19 Technology updates and redesigns that include accessibility along with other best practices have demonstrated reduced costs for maintenance and service. Moreover, according to Microsoft, as accessibility features are included, overall customer satisfaction improves. Designing inclusive software results in improved usability and customer satisfaction. Microsoft’s app developer guide Accessible design considerations often lead to improvements in general customer experience and loyalty. For customers with disabilities, such improvements are essential for equal access. However, accessibility provides options that are useful to all customers in various situations. For example, web accessibility also benefits: people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc., older people with changing abilities due to ageing, people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses, challenging situations like bright, glaring sunlight or noisy environments where audio can’t be heard, those with a slow internet connection, limited or expensive bandwidth, which is common in rural areas and some geographical regions. Case Study: NPR Weekly Broadcast This American Life is a broadcast heard on more than 500 National Public Radio (NPR) stations by about 2.1 million listeners each week in the United States. In 2011, in response to new regulations around broadcast media from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the broadcaster committed to creating transcripts for their entire archive of recorded programs. A study by their media partner, conducted over several months, concluded that the provision of transcripts not only met legal obligations but returned significant benefits including: search traffic increased 6.86%, better comprehension for visitors who use English as a second language, visitors were able to use transcripts in noisy or sound-sensitive environments, ability to more easily translate, and ability to search text to reference a specific section of audio. The study, conducted over more than one year, used Google Analytics to capture the following data: visitor engagement increased 7.23%, unique visitors increased 4.18%, and new inbound links to transcript accounted for an increase of 3.89% Read more detail and the full report of the This American Life Case Study and how it was conducted. Minimize Legal Risk A significant demonstration of the risk of ignoring accessibility requirements was the 2008 settlement by the National Federation of the Blind with Target retailers:20 class damages of $6 million plaintiff legal fees over $3 million undisclosed defense legal fees court oversight of website for several years Consideration of the cost and risk of inaction is a critical aspect of any business case. As web use is woven into modern life all over the world, governments and regulators began to mandate laws and policies that strengthen the rights of people with disabilities to participate in online digital information and services. One of the earliest examples of legal consequences to web accessibility was a complaint put to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission (HREOC) in 2000 about the inaccessibility of the website of the Sydney Olympics. The plaintiff, who was blind, claimed the site was a violation of the Commonwealth Disability Discrimination Act 1992.21 The 2001 decision in the Sydney Olympics suit22 raised awareness of the need to address accessibility in the emerging practice of web communication. Over time, the legal risk increased with the adoption of more specific laws and policies in countries throughout the world. The Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD) is a comprehensive human rights document that includes a direct reference to the rights of all people to have equal access to communications technology. Passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, more than 175 countries ratified it by 2018. The European Commission adopted the European Accessibility Act, requiring ATMs and banking services, PCs, telephones and TV equipment, telephony and audiovisual services, transport, e-books, and e-commerce meet accessibility requirements. In the US, the number of legal actions continues to rise and courts increasingly decide in favor of equal access23, often citing the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Structured Negotiation is another way that legal pressure is effective, encouraging companies to meet accessibility requirements while avoiding litigation.24 In Norway where it is now illegal for commercial websites to fail to provide equivalent access for people with disabilities, the government fines commercial companies that do not comply.25 Austria has had customer protection regulation in place since 2006 requiring most public websites to meet accessibility standards. Customers that believe they have been discriminated against can take legal action. Parties meet in mediation before they are permitted to go to court. In the United States, by contrast, the regulation is less clear but legal action continues to accelerate.26 Between government oversight and regulation on the one hand, and increased legal action on the other, the legal landscape is rapidly changing in favor of equal access. With legal risks increasing, smart businesses – particularly those with global activities – are creating accessibility policies and programs to mitigate risk to protect both their assets and their reputations. Case Study: ADA and Website Accessibility The blind plaintiff shopped at the local Winn-Dixie grocery store and pharmacy in person but was unable to access the website for information such as the store locator, coupons, store events, and specials. The historic suit was the first trial in the history of the ADA about the accessibility of a public accommodation’s website. Winn-Dixie asked the court to dismiss the suit based on their argument that a website is not a public accommodation covered by Title III of the ADA. The court decided otherwise, allowing the plaintiff to recover their attorney fees. The decision included the following conclusions by the court: The link between the website and Winn-Dixie Stores was a circumstance that made Title III of the ADA, applicable to “Public Accommodations,” relevant in this situation. The website must be made accessible to “individuals with disabilities who use computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.” The court required the chain of grocery stores to adopt and post an explicit Accessibility Policy “to ensure the persons with disabilities have full and equal enjoyment of its website and shall accompany the public policy statement with an accessible means of submitting accessibility questions and problems.” conduct annual accessibility training for IT and web staff, so they learn to create and maintain content that meets WCAG criteria. make sure that any third-party applications or content posted to the Winn-Dixie site must also meet WCAG requirements. Share your experience User experience research and case studies confirm the many ways that accessible design supports an organization’s ability to innovate, enhance their brand, increase market reach, and minimize legal risk – among many other benefits. The WAI is a global community of practice, and we encourage you to share your examples. If you have a story of how your commitment to accessibility improved your online business model, please submit it via email to wai-eo-editors@w3.org or post it to the WAI-Engage wiki . Conclusion Public use of the web is more than 25 years old. It is no longer a novelty but an integrated, critical tool of modern life. As smart businesses integrate accessible design into their development and procurement processes, they understand the need for equal access by all people. The legal risks of ignoring accessibility are significant, and the benefits have also been demonstrated by leaders like Apple, Barclays, NPR, IBM, Microsoft and hundreds more. Business leaders and the advocates who influence them can have a tremendous social impact and healthy return on investment as they follow a roadmap that leads to equal access. More than one billion people with disabilities in the world are eager to engage with you as customers, clients, partners, employees, and equal participants in civic and social activities. By developing a long-term commitment to accessibility and by using WAI resources to develop policy and implement a strategy to bring that commitment to life, your business will reach this market and is likely to thrive in unexpected and self-sustaining ways. Resources This article was written after reading and exploring many external resources that shaped our understanding of the current landscape. We have provided links and notes about our research in this Annotated Bibliography.

All success criteria from 2.0 are included in 2.1. The 2.0 success criteria are exactly the same (verbatim, word-for-word) in 2.1. WCAG 2.1 provides 17 additional success criteria to address: mobile accessibility people with low vision people with cognitive and learning disabilities Guideline 1.3 Adaptable Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure. 1.3.4 Orientation (AA) Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential . Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair: Problem:I can't rotate my tablet &mdash; it's attached to my wheelchair. Works well:The application works whether I attach my tablet horizontally or vertically. Understanding Orientation 1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose (AA) The purpose of each input field collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined when: The input field serves a purpose identified in the Input Purposes for User Interface Components section ; and The content is implemented using technologies with support for identifying the expected meaning for form input data. Supermarket assistant with dyslexia and dyscalculia: Problem:My address is so complicated. There's lots of numbers and long words. It's hard to type it all without making mistakes. Works well:I love websites that can automatically fill it all in for me. Then I don't have to work so hard to get the numbers and spelling right. Note: This works because the fields use autocomplete. Understanding Identify Input Purpose 1.3.6 Identify Purpose (AAA) In content implemented using markup languages, the purpose of User Interface Components , icons, and regions can be programmatically determined . Gamer with language processing disability: Problem:I have software that changes the words in the navigation into symbols. It doesn't work at all with some websites. Works well:It works pretty good with some websites. Understanding Identify Purpose Guideline 1.4 Distinguishable Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground from background. 1.4.10 Reflow (AA) Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels ; Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels ; Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. Parent with low vision – 20/400: Problem:It's nearly impossible to read text if I have to scroll right and left to read each line. It's disorienting and I lose my place. It makes it hard to understand what I'm reading. Works well:I increase the text size 400% and it reflowed within the width of the window. I can read it easily without scrolling back and forth. Understanding Reflow 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast (AA) The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent color(s): User Interface Components Visual information used to indicate states and boundaries of user interface components , except for inactive components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author; Graphical Objects Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics is essential to the information being conveyed. Retiree with low contrast sensitivity: Problem:I couldn't use the &quot;Order Form&quot; &mdash; there were no text boxes. After a long call with customer service, I learned there were text box borders that were too light for me to see. Works well:It's easy for me to see all the icons and buttons and everything &mdash; even in the sunlight. Understanding Non-text Contrast 1.4.12 Text Spacing (AA) In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text style properties , no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of the following and by changing no other style property: Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size; Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size; Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size; Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size. Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of these text style properties in written text can conform using only the properties that exist for that combination of language and script. Student with dyslexia: and Retiree with low vision: Problem:Most text is hard to read. It's so cluttered I can't keep my focus. Just increasing the space between lines makes all the difference. When I'm really tired, I also increase the space between words. Works well:OK, I know I'm a bit of a geek, but I've perfected a user style sheet to make text spacing just right for me. It's a relief when websites work with my CSS. Understanding Text Spacing 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus (AA) Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true: Dismissable A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid. Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author. Teacher with low vision who uses screen magnification software: Problem:I was moving my mouse around to track what I was looking at on a web page. It helps me keep focused. Then -boom- this little box popped up. It covered what I was trying to read and I couldn't get it to go away. Works well:I hovered over a word and a box popped up with the definition, but it was mostly off the screen with my magnification. I moved my mouse pointer to the definition box and scrolled the magnified area over to the definition box and it stayed popped up so I could read it. Understanding Content on Hover or Focus Guideline 2.1 Keyboard Accessible Make all functionality available from a keyboard. 2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts (A) If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then at least one of the following is true: Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is available to remap the shortcut to use one or more non-printable keyboard characters (e.g. Ctrl, Alt, etc). Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user interface component is only active when that component has focus. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:When I was using my mail app with voice commands, it kept deleting the messages instead of opening them. Note: There was a shortcut key for delete that was triggered by something he was saying, and no way to turn off the shortcut keys. Works well:In my spreadsheet application, there's a setting to turn off or modify character key shortcuts. Understanding Character Key Shortcuts Guideline 2.2 Enough Time Provide users enough time to read and use content. 2.2.6 Timeouts (AAA) Users are warned of the duration of any user inactivity that could cause data loss, unless the data is preserved for more than 20 hours when the user does not take any actions. School playground aide with cognitive disabilities: Problem:I was selecting my Employee Benefits and was comparing the different plans. When I went back to select the Health Plan, it had timed out and lost all the information I had already entered. Works well:When I started the Employee Benefits app, it told me how many minutes I had to complete the forms. Understanding Timeouts Guideline 2.3 Seizures and Physical Reactions Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical reactions. 2.3.3 Animation from Interactions (AAA) Motion animation triggered by interaction can be disabled, unless the animation is essential to the functionality or the information being conveyed. Artist with vestibular disorder: Problem:In the online tax app, as I move my mouse around or tab to different fields, this little bubble with the current balance follows me around the screen. Makes me dizzy and nauseous. Works well:I was so glad there was an option to turn off animations. Understanding Animation from Interactions Guideline 2.5 Input Modalities Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond keyboard. 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures (A) All functionality that uses multipoint or path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential . Comic with cerebral palsy who has limited movement in fingers: Problem:I can't move my fingers like that. I need another way to zoom in the map. Works well:Good thing there are buttons to zoom in and out. Understanding Pointer Gestures 2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation (A) For functionality that can be operated using a single pointer , at least one of the following is true: No Down-Event The down-event of the pointer is not used to execute any part of the function; Abort or Undo Completion of the function is on the up-event , and a mechanism is available to abort the function before completion or to undo the function after completion; Up Reversal The up-event reverses any outcome of the preceding down-event; Essential Completing the function on the down-event is essential . Politician with motor disabilities and low vision: Problem:I went to hit the &quot;Mute&quot; button and accidentally touched the &quot;End Call&quot; button instead. It hung up immediately. Works well:In another web conferencing application, if I accidentally touch the &quot;End Call&quot; button, I can just slide my finger off the &quot;End Call&quot; button and it won't end the call. Understanding Pointer Cancellation 2.5.3 Label in Name (A) For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text , the name contains the text that is presented visually. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:It understood most of my voice commands until I got to the Send button. I kept saying 'Send' and it didn't work. Note: It was visually labelled 'send' but the 'name' in the code was 'submit'. It would have worked if the 'name' started with 'send'. Understanding Label in Name 2.5.4 Motion Actuation (A) Functionality that can be operated by device motion or user motion can also be operated by user interface components and responding to the motion can be disabled to prevent accidental actuation, except when: Supported Interface The motion is used to operate functionality through an accessibility supported interface; Essential The motion is essential for the function and doing so would invalidate the activity. Comic with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair: Problem:I can't shake my phone; it's connected to my wheelchair. So there needs to be another way to activate that feature, like a button. Problem:I have tremors, so I need to turn off motion activation &mdash; and then be able to do stuff without motion actuation. Works well:My friend has this cool application that looks like a physical spin lock. She rotates the phone to turn to the combination. I can use the same application by typing the numbers directly. Understanding Motion Actuation 2.5.5 Target Size (AAA) The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels except when: Equivalent The target is available through an equivalent link or control on the same page that is at least 44 by 44 CSS pixels; Inline The target is in a sentence or block of text; User Agent Control The size of the target is determined by the user agent and is not modified by the author; Essential A particular presentation of the target is essential to the information being conveyed. Retiree with hand tremor (and big fingers): Problem:The buttons are so small, I hit &quot;Cancel&quot; when going for &quot;Submit&quot;. Then I have to start all over again. Works well:This website buttons are big enough that I don't hit the wrong button even when I'm riding on the bumpy bus. Understanding Target Size 2.5.6 Concurrent Input Mechanisms (AAA) Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential , required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings. Reporter with repetitive stress injury who uses voice recognition software: Problem:When my RSI acts up, I switch back and forth a lot between keyboard, mouse, stylus, voice. This application doesn't let me use the stylus when I have a keyboard plugged in. Understanding Concurrent Input Mechanisms Guideline 4.1 Compatible Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA) In content implemented using markup languages, status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. Accountant who is blind and uses a screen reader: Problem:I selected a class for the conference, but I can't tell if it got added to my schedule. Works well:When I add a meeting to my calendar, I hear a confirmation. Understanding Status Messages About the Personas Quotes The linked persona roles go to the Stories of Web Users. That page has other personas with different disabilities. We might add more in the future. After we've reviewed these persona quotes sufficiently, we plan to add them to the Understanding documents.",

    "text": "Summary This page introduces the document: “Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT)”. Quick link: WCAG2ICT Note Page Contents Introduction Who WCAG2ICT is for What is in WCAG2ICT Who develops WCAG2ICT Introduction Guidance on Applying WCAG 2.0 to Non-Web Information and Communications Technologies (WCAG2ICT) describes how the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 can be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT). It supports harmonized accessibility solutions across a range of technologies. Background: WCAG 2.0 is a normative web standard — it is a W3C Recommendation and an ISO International Standard (ISO/IEC 40500:2012 ) — that explains how to make web content (including static web pages, dynamic web applications, etc.) more accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG Overview introduces the WCAG documents and links to supporting resources such as WCAG 2.0 at a Glance and How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) . This document: WCAG2ICT is a W3C Working Group Note that is informative — it is not normative and does not set requirements. It provides guidance on the application of WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria to non-web documents and software. WCAG2ICT was developed to provide an authoritative interpretation of how WCAG 2.0 can apply in different contexts. For information on the scope of WCAG2ICT, see the WCAG2ICT Introduction . Note: WCAG2ICT is still relevant for later versions of WCAG 2. For example, WCAG 2.1 does not change the requirements of WCAG 2.0 that are addressed in WCAG2ICT; WCAG 2.1 adds additional requirements. W3C is currently not planning to update WCAG2ICT to add the additional requirements from future versions of WCAG 2. Who WCAG2ICT is for WCAG2ICT is for ICT managers, ICT developers, policy makers, and others wanting to understand how WCAG 2.0 can be applied to non-web documents and software. What is in WCAG2ICT WCAG2ICT provides: Overall context for applying WCAG 2.0 to non-web documents and software. Guidance on applying the WCAG principles, guidelines, and Levels A and AA success criteria to non-web documents and software. Key Terms related to applying WCAG 2.0 to non-web documents and software. Comments on the definitions in the WCAG 2.0 Glossary. Comments on conformance. Background information on some topics. WCAG2ICT includes material from the WCAG 2.0 standard to provide context, along with specific guidance related to non-web ICT, formatted as follows: WCAG 2.0 principles, guidelines, and success criteria — the exact text from the WCAG 2.0 standard. These are visually styled in pale yellow boxes and usually prefaced with “Principle…”, “From Guideline…”, or “From Success Criterion..”. Excerpted text from the “Intent” sections of Understanding WCAG 2.0, an informative supporting document. These are visually styled in pale yellow boxes and prefaced with “Intent from Understanding Success Criterion…”. Guidance on applying each success criteria to non-web documents and software. These are visually styled in pale blue boxes with a heading on a dark blue background that starts with “Additional Guidance…”. Technical document format WCAG2ICT follows the W3C format for technical reports, which has several sections at the beginning, including links to different versions, editors, abstract, and status. Who develops WCAG2ICT WCAG2ICT was developed by the WCAG2ICT Task Force , provided for public review, and approved by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C ) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Comments WCAG2ICT is now a stable W3C Working Group Note, and the WCAG Working Group does not plan to make changes. However, the document can be updated if needed. If you have any comments on the Additional Guidance sections of WCAG2ICT, please send them to the public mailing list public-wcag2ict-comments@w3.org. If you have comments on the wording taken from WCAG 2.0 or Understanding WCAG 2.0, please read the Instructions for Commenting on WCAG 2.0 Documents.",

    "text": "Page Contents Introduction How Involving Users Early Helps How to Involve Users throughout Your Project Getting a Range of Users Working with Users Combine User Involvement with Standards More Information and Guidance Terminology Introduction Involving users early in projects helps you understand real-world accessibility issues, such as how people with disabilities and older people use the web with adaptive strategies and assistive technologies. Involving users early helps you implement more effective accessibility solutions. It also broadens your perspective and can lead you to discover new ways of thinking about your product that makes it work better for more people in more situations. This applies when designing and developing: websites and web applications browsers, media players, and assistive technologies authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors accessibility standards and policies web technologies and technical specifications, such as HTML This page gets you started reaping the benefits of involving users — specifically people with disabilities and older people with accessibility needs due to aging — early and throughout different types of projects. A separate page focuses on including users in evaluation for web development projects. How Involving Users Early Helps Involving users early in web projects results in better products for users, more efficient development, and other benefits to project stakeholders. Better Accessibility and Better Usability for All Users When developers understand accessibility issues, they can implement more effective accessibility solutions. For example, their website will work better and be more usable for people with disabilities, older users, and other target groups. Making websites and web tools more usable for people with a range of disabilities improves general usability for everybody, including people without disabilities. (You could say that involving users with disabilities in your development project gives you improved usability for free.) This benefits users, and also stakeholders. For example, when websites get increased use and other business benefits from increased accessibility. More Efficient Development Including users in the development process helps you more efficiently develop accessible products that work well for real users in real situations. This can help maximize your return on investment (ROI) in accessibility. When you understand how people use the web and your particular product, you can: plan accessibility into appropriate project phases from the beginning more quickly develop accessibility solutions make informed decisions between different options, and avoid wasting time guessing limit having to go back and fix problems avoid having to make compromises later because you waited too long to address accessibility have a better perspective on accessibility standards, guidelines, and other requirements (which you might need to meet now or later, for example, if you sell to the government) All these benefit developers, project managers, and other stakeholders. Motivation When designers and developers see people with disabilities use products like theirs, most are highly motivated by a new understanding of accessibility. They understand the human interaction aspects of accessibility and go beyond approaching accessibility as only a checklist item. Designers and developers can see the opportunity for their work to impact lives. When managers and stakeholders share such experiences of people with disabilities using their products, it often helps get resources budgeted and scheduled to address accessibility well. How to Involve Users throughout Your Project This section focuses on including real people in the process. Address accessibility from the earliest stage of the project. For example, consider accessibility during planning, budgeting, scheduling and such. Include accessibility in your user-centered design processes (UCD) or other design methodologies and techniques. For example, ensure that people with disabilities and older users are included in use cases, user analysis, personas, scenarios, workflows, design walkthroughs, etc. Below are the basics that you can do yourself to include users in your projects. If you have the resources, consider getting assistance from accessibility, disability, and user-centered design specialists. Including Users to Understand the Issues As early as possible in your project: Learn the basics of how people with disabilities use the web by reading online resources and watching videos. Find people with disabilities, with a range of characteristics. See Getting a Range of Users and Working with Users below. Learn about general issues related to the type of product you are developing (website, web application, authoring tool, standard, etc.). Ask people to show you related products that work well for them. Then, ask them to show you problems in products that do not work well. Ask lots of questions to help you understand the accessibility issues. Including Users in Implementation For example, for websites, web applications, and web tools: When you are considering a specific design aspect, such as expanding/collapsing navigation, find other products that are already doing it. Ask users to explore with you what works well and what does not. Throughout your design and development, ask users to review prototypes. Give them specific tasks to complete and see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved. Ask lots of questions. For more in this, see Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility, especially the sections on Analyzing Accessibility Issues and Drawing Conclusions and Reporting. Carefully Consider Input Caution: Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web. They might not know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of users is best. Getting a Range of Users People with disabilities are as diverse as any people. They have diverse experiences, expectations, and preferences. They use diverse interaction techniques, adaptive strategies, and assistive technology configurations. People have different disabilities: auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual. Some people have multiple disabilities. Even within one category, there is extreme variation. For example, “visual disability” includes people who have been totally blind since birth, people who have distortion in their central vision from age-related degeneration, and people who temporarily have blurry vision from an injury or disease. Include users with a variety of disabilities and user characteristics. Most projects have limited time and budget and cannot include many different users. Selecting the optimum number of users with the best suited characteristics can be difficult. There are resources on the web that provide guidance on selecting participants with disabilities. For example, determining participant characteristics and finding participants with disabilities. Users’ Experience Interacting with the Web A primary consideration in selecting users is their experience interacting with the web. For example, some assistive technologies (AT) are complicated and difficult to learn. A user with insufficient experience may not know how to use the AT effectively. And a very advanced user might know uncommon work-arounds to overcome problems in a website that the “average” user would not be able to handle. In the early stages when you are first learning how people with disabilities interact with the web, it is usually best to get people with a fairly high experience level. (Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility says more about different experience levels in later evaluation phases.) Working with Users Follow common practices for working with people informally and formally, for example: Develop appropriate relationships with your users. For example, spending time talking informally over lunch may help you work together more comfortably. Ensure informed consent and other research ethics. For example, tell participants in studies that they are free to stop at any time. Treat people with disabilities and older users with the respect you would any other users. For example, respect their time and provide appropriate compensation. There are resources on the web that provide detailed guidance on working with users; for example, Interacting with People with Disabilities, Assistive Technology and Location, and The RESPECT Code of Practice. Combine User Involvement with Standards Including users with disabilities and older users with accessibility needs is key to making your accessibility efforts more effective and more efficient. Yet that alone cannot address all issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. That is the role of accessibility standards. For websites and web applications, using comprehensive standards such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 helps ensure that you address all issues. Combine user involvement with evaluating conformance to WCAG to ensure that accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and situations. For authoring tools such as content management systems (CMS), blog software, and WYSIWYG editors, follow Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). For browsers, media players, and other ‘user agents’, follow User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). More Information and Guidance This document briefly addresses a few points of a very complex topic. Many resources on other aspects of involving users throughout projects are available on the web, such as: Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility provides more details on specifically on evaluation with users. Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design provides detailed guidance on incorporating accessibility throughout projects. For example, see Incorporating Accessibility Early and Throughout. Terminology adaptive strategies Adaptive strategies are techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. For example, increasing the font size in a common browser. Adaptive strategies include techniques with mainstream browsers or with assistive technologies. assistive technologies Assistive technologies are software or equipment that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. For example, screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse. user characteristics User characteristics typically include things like age, job responsibilities, software, hardware, environment (for example, home, shared office, private office, shared public terminal), computer experience, and web experience. User characteristics can also include type of disability, adaptive strategies used, and experience with specific assistive technologies. web content Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including text, images, forms, sounds, and such. More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents, which are linked from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview.",

    "text": "Page Contents Introduction Initial Review Range of User Evaluation Basics Analyzing Accessibility Issues Combine User Evaluation with Standards Drawing Conclusions and Reporting Note for usability professionals More Information and Guidance Introduction Web accessibility evaluation often focuses on conformance to accessibility standards such as WCAG. While conformance is important, there are many benefits to evaluating with real people. For example, to learn how your website or web tool really works for users and to better understand accessibility issues. Evaluating with users with disabilities and with older users identifies usability issues that are not discovered by conformance evaluation alone. This page is part of a multi-page Evaluating Web Accessibility resource suite that outlines different aspects of evaluating web accessibility. It is the second of two pages on including users in web projects. Please read Including Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility, which covers broader issues of including users early in website design, tool development, standards, and other web projects. Initial Review A first step in evaluating web accessibility is reviewing the website to check for any obvious accessibility problems. The Preliminary Review and Conformance Evaluation pages provide guidance. Even web developers with little accessibility knowledge can find some accessibility issues through a preliminary review. An accessibility expert with first-hand experience of how people with different disabilities interact with the web can: evaluate accessibility issues for a broad range of users, which might not be found by individual users; help fix any known barriers before bringing in users; and focus the evaluation with users on potential areas of concern. The initial review identifies any significant accessibility barriers to fix before evaluating with users. It also helps define what to focus on for evaluation with users. Range of User Evaluation Users with disabilities and older users can be included in a wide range of evaluation activities, from brief consultations to large-scale usability studies. There are many options in between these extremes: Informal evaluations of specific accessibility issues can be very simple. For example, ask someone you know who uses a screen reader or someone with other disabilities to find some data in an early draft of a data table. Observe their interaction and discuss the issues. Formal usability testing of a website follows established protocols to gather quantitative and qualitative data from representative users performing specific tasks. Formal usability tests can be optimized to focus on accessibility issues. What type of evaluation you do depends on factors such as the stage in your project, for example, initial investigation of design ideas, testing specific areas of prototypes, or reviewing final designs. Conducting informal evaluations throughout development is more effective than only formal usability testing at the end of a project. Basics In most cases, including users in evaluation involves: getting a few people with disabilities - and depending on your target audience, older users, including them throughout the development process to complete sample tasks on prototypes so you can see how the different aspects of the design and coding could be improved, and discussing accessibility issues with them. See Including Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility for guidance on getting a range of users and users’ experience interacting with the web Just as with any evaluation with users, whether you include novice, average, or advanced users depends on your target users. For example, if you are developing a web application for accountants inside a company, you probably want advanced assistive technology users. And for a public website to apply for disability benefits, you want novice assistive technology users. Caution: Carefully consider all input. Avoid assuming that input from one person with a disability applies to all people with disabilities. A person with a disability does not necessarily know how other people with the same disability interact with the web. They might not know enough about other disabilities to provide valid guidance on other accessibility issues. Getting input from a range of users is best. Note: In addition to finding accessibility problems, evaluating with users with disabilities usually reveals general usability problems that impact all users, including those without disabilities. Analyzing Accessibility Issues Web accessibility depends on several components of web development and interaction working together, including web browsers, assistive technologies (AT), and web content. Accessibility problems can be caused by one or more different components. For example, if a user who cannot use a mouse has trouble with keyboard access, it could be because: the developer did not markup/code the web page properly, or the browser or media player isn’t handling the markup properly, or the user’s AT isn’t handling the markup properly, or the user doesn’t know how to use the browser, media player, or AT’s keyboard access features, or the page is poorly designed and it is a general usability problem for all users, including those without disabilities. Combine User Evaluation with Standards Involving users with disabilities in evaluation has many benefits. Yet that alone cannot determine if a website is accessible. Combine user involvement with evaluating conformance to WCAG to ensure that accessibility is provided to users with a range of disabilities and situations. Drawing Conclusions and Reporting Be careful drawing conclusions from limited evaluations or studies. Results from only a couple of people with disabilities cannot be generalized to apply to all people with similar disabilities or people with other disabilities. See the Caution above. Include in the reports the scope of the study and the evaluation parameters, such as testing methods and user characteristics. For example, if a study included only participants who are blind, the report should clarify that it did not evaluate conformance to accessibility standards and that it does not apply to all people with disabilities. While small studies often provide useful information, they are not robust enough to provide statistical significance. Note for usability professionals When specifically exploring accessibility barriers, the protocol is usually different from a general usability test. For example: you would likely use a think-aloud technique with high facilitator interaction; data collection would focus on understanding errors related to accessibility barriers, rather than on time-on-task or user satisfaction; and tasks would concentrate on specific areas of concern for potential accessibility problems, rather than general site usage. Note that it is also important to evaluate other factors for users with disabilities. These factors include: General usability, user satisfaction, and other similar criteria. The More Information section below includes additional guidance specifically for usability professionals. More Information and Guidance This document briefly addresses a few points of a very complex topic. Many resources on other aspects of involving users in evaluation are available on the Web. Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility is a prerequisite for this document. It covers broader issues of including users early in website design, tool development, standards, and other web projects. Just Ask: Integrating Accessibility Throughout Design provides guidance on incorporating accessibility throughout design of websites and other products. The chapter on Usability Testing for Accessibility includes: Planning for usability testing for accessibility – determining participant characteristics, recruiting participants, providing compensation Preparing for usability testing for accessibility – preparing test materials, ensuring the facility is accessible, setting up and testing the assistive technology, conducting a pilot test, using screening techniques Conducting a usability test for accessibility – interacting with people with disabilities, setting up the room Reporting usability testing for accessibility – distinguishing between accessibility and usability issues, drawing conclusions, writing about people with disabilities White paper: conducting user evaluations with people with disabilities Many books, articles, conference presentations, and other resources cover usability evaluation techniques. They include different types of usability testing; test design; developing test protocol including questionnaires, tasks, data collection; conducting pilot tests; and how many participants to include in usability testing. For example: Usability Testing Demystified, sample test plans and forms from The Handbook of Usability Testing, and Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems with a sample usability test, scripts, and forms online. There are organizations around the world that specialize in helping recruit people with disabilities and conduct evaluations with users with disabilities.",

    "title": "How WAI Develops Accessibility Standards through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute",
    "text": "Introduction The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops web accessibility guidelines, technical specifications, and educational resources to help make the web accessible to people with disabilities. This document introduces how WAI works through a process designed to: ensure broad community input, and encourage consensus development. Page Contents W3C Standards Milestones Other Resources Community Collaboration W3C Standards The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops web standards such as HTML, CSS, etc. WAI is part of W3C and follows the W3C Process for developing web standards. W3C’s web standards are called W3C Recommendations. WAI has developed several W3C Recommendations, including: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, see WCAG Overview Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines, see ATAG Overview User Agent Accessibility Guidelines, see UAAG Overview Accessible Rich Internet Applications, see WAI-ARIA Overview [WAI Accessibility Guidelines] that are [W3C Recommendations] are [Web Standards] Milestones The milestones that a W3C “technical report” goes through on its way to becoming a W3C Recommendation are listed below. Working Draft: Working Drafts are published and announced specifically to ask for review and input from the community. Often there are issues that a Working Group would particularly like input on. Usually multiple Working Drafts of a technical report are published. Wide Review Working Draft: When a Working Group believes it has addressed all comments and technical requirements, it provides the complete document for community review and announces that it is ready for wide review. Candidate Recommendation: The main purpose of Candidate Recommendation is to ensure that the technical report can be implemented. W3C encourages developers to use the technical report in their projects. The technical report is stable at this stage; however, it may change based on implementation experience. Proposed Recommendation: After there are implementations of each feature of the technical report, W3C announces it as a Proposed Recommendation. At this stage, the report is submitted to the W3C Membership for endorsement. W3C Recommendation (Web Standard): Once there is significant support for the technical report from the W3C Members, the W3C Director, and the public, it is published as a Recommendation. W3C encourages widespread deployment of its Recommendations. That was a simplified description of the process. For the definitive version, see the W3C Process Document, Section 7: W3C Technical Report Development Process. Other Resources WAI also develops documents that support the guidelines and do not go through the process described above. W3C Working Group Notes are advisory technical reports, not standards. Most of WAI’s Techniques documents are Notes. They help developers implement the WAI guidelines. For example, Techniques for WCAG gives specific details and practical examples of how to meet WCAG. WAI Resources and EOWG Resources cover a wide range of web accessibility topics, such as Essential Components of Web Accessibility, WCAG 2.0 at a Glance, Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility, and many others listed in the WAI Resources. Community Collaboration WAI’s W3C Recommendations, Working Group Notes, and Resources are developed in WAI Working Groups with input from the community. WAI actively encourages broad participation from industry, disability organizations, accessibility researchers, government, and others interested in web accessibility. Participating in WAI describes ways that you can contribute to WAI’s accessibility work, including reviewing and commenting on WAI guidelines as they are being developed. The best time to comment is when WAI announces Working Drafts for review. Please send your comments early in the process, when the Working Group can most effectively address them in the developing technical report. Technical comments sent after the wide review period have less weight, and a Working Group might not be able to make substantive changes late in the process. The W3C Process Document provides more information on Reviews and Review Responsibilities. To get WAI announcements, you can subscribe to the following: WAI Interest Group mailing list WAI RSS Feed The review announcements tell you the review period dates and where to send comments.",

    "title": "Accessibility Principles",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces some of the web accessibility requirements for websites, web applications, browsers, and other tools. It provides references to the international standards from W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) and to stories of web users. Note: This is not a complete list of all accessibility requirements. Page Contents Web accessibility standards Perceivable information and user interface Text alternatives for non-text content Captions and other alternatives for multimedia Content can be presented in different ways Content is easier to see and hear Operable user interface and navigation Functionality is available from a keyboard Users have enough time to read and use the content Content does not cause seizures Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are Understandable information and user interface Text is readable and understandable Content appears and operates in predictable ways Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes Robust content and reliable interpretation Content is compatible with current and future user tools Web accessibility standards Web accessibility relies on several components that work together. Some of these include: Web content - refers to any part of a website, including text, images, forms, and multimedia, as well as any markup code, scripts, applications, and such. User agents - software that people use to access web content, including desktop graphical browsers, voice browsers, mobile phone browsers, multimedia players, plug-ins, and some assistive technologies. Authoring tools - software or services that people use to produce web content, including code editors, document conversion tools, content management systems, blogs, database scripts, and other tools. More about web accessibility standards These components inter-relate and support each other. For instance, web content needs to include text alternatives for images. This information needs to be processed by web browsers and then conveyed to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. To create such text alternatives, authors need authoring tools that support them to do so. More background is provided in Essential Components of Web Accessibility. Standards play a vital role in defining accessibility requirements for each of these components. Some accessibility requirements are easy to meet, yet understanding the basics of how people with disabilities use the Web helps implement them more effectively and efficiently. Some aspects of accessibility require more technical skills or advanced knowledge of how people use the Web. In all cases, involving users early and throughout your web projects will make your work better and easier. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides a set of guidelines that are internationally recognized as the standard for web accessibility. These include: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) There is also a WAI specification for Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA), which include dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, JavaScript, and related web technologies. Perceivable information and user interface Text alternatives for non-text content Text alternatives are equivalents for non-text content. Examples include: Short equivalents for images, including icons, buttons, and graphics; Description of data represented on charts, diagrams, and illustrations; Brief descriptions of non-text content such as audio and video files; Labels for form controls, input, and other user interface components. Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image or function to provide an equivalent user experience. For instance, an appropriate text alternative for a search button would be “search” rather than “magnifying lens”. Text alternatives can be presented in a variety of ways. For instance, they can be read aloud for people who cannot see the screen and for people with reading difficulties, enlarged to custom text sizes, or displayed on braille devices. Text alternatives serve as labels for controls and functionality to aid keyboard navigation and navigation by voice recognition (speech input). They also act as labels to identify audio, video, and files in other formats, as well as applications that are embedded as part of a website. Accessibility requirements related to text alternatives (links to technical specification) WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.1 - Text Alternatives UAAG 2.0 Guideline 1.1 - Alternative content ATAG 2.0 Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines Guideline A.2.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Make alternative content available to authors Guideline A.2.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that editing-view presentation can be programmatically determined Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents Part B. Support the production of accessible content Stories related to text alternatives Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Captions and other alternatives for multimedia People who cannot hear audio or see video need alternatives. Examples include: Text transcripts and captions for audio content, such as recordings of a radio interview; Audio descriptions, which are narrations to describe important visual details in a video; Sign language interpretation of audio content, including relevant auditory experiences. Well-written text transcripts containing the correct sequence of any auditory or visual information provide a basic level of accessibility and facilitate the production of captions and audio descriptions. Accessibility requirements related to multimedia (links to technical specification) WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.2 - Time-based Media UAAG 2.0 Guideline 1.1 - Alternative content ATAG 2.0 Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines Guideline A.2.1: (For the authoring tool user interface) Make alternative content available to authors Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents Part B. Support the production of accessible content Stories related to multimedia Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Content can be presented in different ways For users to be able to change the presentation of content, it is necessary that: Headings, lists, tables and other structures in the content are marked-up properly; Sequences of information or instructions are independent of any presentation; Browsers and assistive technologies provide settings to customize the presentation. Meeting this requirement allows content to be correctly read aloud, enlarged, or adapted to meet the needs and preferences of different people. For instance, it can be presented using custom color combinations, text size, or other styling to facilitate reading. This requirement also facilitates other forms of adaptation, including automatic generation of page outlines and summaries to help people get an overview and to focus on particular parts more easily. Accessibility requirements related to adaptability (links to technical specification) WCAG 2.0 Guideline 1.3 - Adaptable UAAG 2.0 Guideline 1.4 - Text configuration Guideline 1.5 - Volume configuration Guideline 1.6 - Synthesized speech configuration Guideline 1.7 - User style sheet configuration Guideline 1.9 - Alternative views Guideline 1.10 - Element Information ATAG 2.0 Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines Guideline A.2.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that editing-view presentation can be programmatically determined Guideline A.3.7: (For the authoring tool user interface) Ensure that previews are at least as accessible as in-market user agents Part B. Support the production of accessible content Stories related to adaptability Lee, online shopper with color blindness Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Content is easier to see and hear Distinguishable content is easier to see and hear. Such content includes: Color is not used as the only way of conveying information or identifying content; Default foreground and background color combinations provide sufficient contrast; Text is resizable up to 200% without losing information, using a standard browser; Images of text are resizable, replaced with actual text, or avoided where possible; Users can pause, stop, or adjust the volume of audio that is played on a website; Background audio is low or can be turned off, to avoid interference or distraction. Meeting this requirement helps separate foreground from background, to make important information more distinguishable. This includes considerations for people who do not use assistive technologies and for people using assistive technologies who may observe interference from prominent audio or visual content in the background. For instance, many people with color blindness do not use any particular tools and rely on a proper design that provides sufficient color contrast between text and its surrounding background. For others, audio that is automatically played could interfere with text-to-speech or with assistive listening devices (ALDs).

This requires keyboard access to all functionality, including form controls, input, and other user interface components. Keyboard accessibility includes: All functionality that is available by mouse is also available by keyboard; Keyboard focus does not get trapped in any part of the content; Web browsers, authoring tools, and other tools provide keyboard support. Meeting this requirement helps keyboard users, including people using alternative keyboards such as keyboards with ergonomic layouts, on-screen keyboards, or switch devices. It also helps people using voice recognition (speech input) to operate websites and to dictate text through the keyboard interface.

Support the production of accessible content Stories related to keyboard accessibility Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Users have enough time to read and use the content Some people need more time than others to read and use the content. For instance, some people require more time to type text, understand instructions, operate controls, or to otherwise complete tasks on a website. Examples of providing enough time include providing mechanisms to: Stop, extend, or adjust time limits, except where necessary; Pause, stop, or hide moving, blinking, or scrolling content; Postpone or suppress interruptions, except where necessary; Re-authenticate when a session expires without losing data. Accessibility requirements related to sufficient time (links to technical specification) WCAG 2.0 Guideline 2.2 - Enough time UAAG 2.0 Guideline 2.8 - Time-independent interaction Guideline 2.10 - Time-based media ATAG 2.0 Principle A.1: Authoring tool user interfaces follow applicable accessibility guidelines Guideline A.3.2: (For the authoring tool user interface) Provide authors with enough time Part B.

Support the production of accessible content Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are Well organized content helps users to orient themselves and to navigate effectively. Such content includes: Pages have clear titles and are organized using descriptive section headings; There is more than one way to find relevant pages within a set of web pages; Users are informed about their current location within a set of related pages; There are ways to bypass blocks of content that are repeated on multiple pages; The keyboard focus is visible, and the focus order follows a meaningful sequence; The purpose of a link is evident, ideally even when the link is viewed on its own. Meeting this requirement helps people to navigate through web pages in different ways, depending on their particular needs and preferences. For instance, while some people rely on hierarchical navigation structures such as menu bars to find specific web pages, others rely on search functions on websites instead. Some people may be seeing the content while others may be hearing it or seeing and hearing it at the same time. Some people may be using the content with only a mouse or a keyboard, while others may be using both.

Such content includes: Identifying the primary language of a web page, such as Arabic, Dutch, or Korean; Identifying the language of text passages, phrases, or other parts of a web page; Providing definitions for any unusual words, phrases, idioms, and abbreviations; Using the clearest and simplest language possible, or providing simplified versions. Meeting this requirement helps software, including assistive technology, to process text content correctly. For instance, this requirement helps software to read the content aloud, to generate page summaries, and to provide definitions for unusual words such as technical jargon. It also helps people who have difficulty understanding more complex sentences, phrases, and vocabulary. In particular, it helps people with different types of cognitive disabilities.

Examples of making content more predictable include: Navigation mechanisms that are repeated on multiple pages appear in the same place each time; User interface components that are repeated on web pages have the same labels each time; Significant changes on a web page do not happen without the consent of the user. Meeting this requirement helps people to quickly learn the functionality and navigation mechanisms provided on a website, and to operate them according to their specific needs and preferences. For instance, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use to enhance keyboard navigation. Others memorize the steps to reach certain pages or to complete processes on a website. Both rely on predictable and consistent functionality.

Examples of helping users to avoid and correct mistakes include: Descriptive instructions, error messages, and suggestions for correction; Context-sensitive help for more complex functionality and interaction; Opportunity to review, correct, or reverse submissions if necessary. Meeting this requirement helps people who do not see or hear the content, and may not recognize implicit relationships, sequences, and other cues. It also helps people who do not understand the functionality, are disoriented or confused, forget, or make mistakes using forms and interaction for any other reason.

Examples of how this can be achieved include: Ensuring markup can be reliably interpreted, for instance by ensuring it is valid; Providing a name, role, and value for non-standard user interface components. Meeting this requirement helps maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies. In particular, it enables assistive technologies to process the content reliably, and to present or to operate it in different ways. This includes non-standard (scripted) buttons, input fields, and other controls.

    "title": "Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Page Contents Introduction Recommended Expertise Appendix Introduction Evaluating the accessibility of Web content for people with disabilities requires diverse kinds of expertise and perspectives. While it is possible for individuals to evaluate Web accessibility effectively if they have training and experience across a broad range of disciplines, it is less likely that one individual will have all the expertise that a collaborative approach can bring.  This document describes:  recommended expertise for evaluating Web accessibility approaches for creating collaborative evaluation processes considerations for effective collaboration in different settings References to related evaluation resources are mentioned throughout this document. Most of these resources can be found in, Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview. Recommended Expertise Effective evaluation of Web accessibility requires more than simply running an evaluation tool on a Web site. Comprehensive and effective evaluations require evaluators with an understanding of Web technologies, evaluation tools, barriers that people with disabilities experience, assistive technologies and approaches that people with disabilities use, and accessibility guidelines and techniques. The following list includes recommended expertise across a variety of areas, and provides links to initial resources, listed in the Appendix at the end of this document, which may be useful in learning more about those areas.  Web technologies Validation tools for Web technologies Web Content Accessibility Guidelines and Techniques Approaches for evaluating Web accessibility Use of a variety of evaluation tools for Web site accessibility Disability barriers, assistive technologies, and adaptive strategies Involvement of people with disabilities in evaluation Approaches for Collaborative Evaluation When first conducting a Web accessibility evaluation, the initial approach in many organizations is to assign the task to an individual within the organization, or to outsource it. However, many organizations use a collaborative evaluation process involving the skills and perspectives of multiple evaluators. This approach allows an organization to use in-house expertise as well as outside experts where needed. Collaborative evaluation processes can involve: a group of colleagues distributed within a larger organization; for instance, Web developers from different units of a large corporation working together a Web development or quality assurance team within a larger organization, which brings in outside experts to help them conduct evaluations in the short term and helps them build improved capability for in-house evaluation over the long term a small business whose mission is to provide accessibility evaluation services, and which does so with a multi-disciplinary team disability advocates from different organizations who collaborate in online fora to monitor accessibility of Web sites a group of individuals distributed across related organizations such as government agencies, each with the obligation to monitor accessibility of their own Web site, who combine their diverse expertise &amp; perspectives for higher quality evaluations Considerations in Combining Expertise Centralized versus distributed evaluation capability Organizations with in-house evaluation capacity sometimes use a centralized group of evaluators, and sometimes use evaluators who are distributed across the organization. A centralized team can serve as a resource for the rest of the organization. Evaluation capability that is distributed across an organization may offer more possibilities for integrating accessibility work into Web development processes throughout the organization. It may help in identifying more diverse expertise since one can look beyond the boundaries of a centralized team. In addition, it can help in developing a shared organizational mission for continual improvement of accessibility, rather than leaving oversight of accessibility as the responsibility of a single office. Identification of external expertise Once gaps in internal expertise are clear, an organization can prioritize its needs for external expertise. The internal gaps are often in areas of knowledge specific to disability and/or accessibility; for instance, Web accessibility guidelines, cross-disability accessibility barriers, or use of assistive technologies. In addition, even organizations with established user testing processes may need guidance on how to get feedback from users with disabilities. It can be valuable in some cases to bring in more than one outside expert to cover this range of issues effectively, or to look for feedback in online communities focusing on Web accessibility. Involving users in evaluation Inclusion of people with disabilities in a collaborative group can contribute to a better understanding of accessibility issues within the organization, and/or to maintaining awareness of the urgency of addressing accessibility barriers on a site, in addition to their individual technical contributions to the evaluation. Regardless of the collective expertise of a collaborative group of evaluators in conducting conformance evaluations, an organization may want to ensure periodic review by users with a variety of disabilities. There are many factors to consider in effectively involving users in Web accessibility evaluations, including ensuring diversity in disabilities represented, types of assistive technology used, and experience with the Web. Facilitating collaboration through shared tools and templates A group of evaluators may want to arrange for shared access to certain evaluation tools, or to ensure that they have access to a broad range of evaluation tools across the group as a whole. Using an agreed-upon template for reporting the results of evaluations can greatly facilitate coordination between different evaluators. Such a template might be an adaptation of the Template for Accessibility Evaluation Reports. Communicating results Collaborative teams may want to give particular attention to communicating the results of their evaluations to their customers clearly, since their reports represent the combined perspectives of different evaluators.  Getting and giving feedback Providing a mechanism for feedback within an organization on the usefulness of the evaluation process and resulting report may assist collaborative evaluators in ongoing identification of gaps in expertise, and contribute to long-term improvement in the quality of evaluations. Feedback from experienced groups of evaluators on evaluation resources such as W3C/WAI’s resources inEvaluating Web Accessibility Overview can, over time, also help improve the quality of evaluation support resources available to the broader Web community. Feedback links are available in the footers of pages in this Evaluation resource suite.

    "title": "Essential Components of Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Summary This page shows how web accessibility depends on several components working together, and how improvements in specific components could substantially improve web accessibility. It provides the foundation for understanding the different accessibility standards developed by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Page Contents How the Components Relate Interdependencies Between Components Guidelines and Other Standards Introduction It is essential that several different components of web development and interaction work together in order for the web to be accessible to people with disabilities. These components include: content - the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. web browsers, media players, and other “user agents” assistive technology, in some cases - screen readers, alternative keyboards, switches, scanning software, etc. users’ knowledge, experiences, and in some cases, adaptive strategies using the web developers - designers, coders, authors, etc., including developers with disabilities and users who contribute content authoring tools - software that creates websites evaluation tools - web accessibility evaluation tools, HTML validators, CSS validators, etc. How the Components Relate Web developers usually use authoring tools and evaluation tools to create web content. People (“users”) use web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, or other “user agents” to get and interact with the content. Interdependencies Between Components There are significant interdependencies between the components; that is, the components must work together in order for the web to be accessible. For example, for alternative text on images: technical specifications address alternative text (for example,    HTML defines the alternative text attribute (alt) of the image    element (img)) WAI guidelines (WCAG, ATAG, UAAG described below) - define how to implement alternative text for accessibility in the different components developers provide the appropriate alternative text wording authoring tools enable, facilitate, and promote providing alternative text in a web page evaluation tools are used to help check that alternative text exists user agents provide human and machine interface to the alternative text assistive technologies provide human interface to the alternative text in various modalities users know how to get the alternative text from their user agent and/or assistive technology as needed The Implementation Cycle When accessibility features are effectively implemented in one component, the other components are more likely to implement them. When web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and other user agents support an accessibility feature, users are more likely to demand it and developers are more likely to implement it in their content. When developers want to implement an accessibility feature in their content, they are more likely to demand that their authoring tool make it easy to implement. When authoring tools make a feature easy to implement, developers are more likely to implement it in their content. When an accessibility feature is implemented in most content, developers and users are more likely to demand that user agents support it. When One Component is Weak If an accessibility feature is not implemented in one component, there is little motivation for the other components to implement it when it does not result in an accessible user experience. For example, developers are unlikely to implement an accessibility feature that authoring tools do not support and that most browsers or assistive technologies do not implement consistently. If one component has poor accessibility support, sometimes other components can compensate through “work-arounds” that require much more effort and are not good for accessibility overall. For example, developers can do more work to compensate for some lack of accessibility support in authoring tools; for example, coding markup directly instead of through a tool users can do more work to compensate for some lack of accessibility support in browsers, media players, and assistive technology and lack of accessibility of content; for example, using different browsers or assistive technologies to overcome different accessibility issues However, in most cases the works-arounds are not implemented and the result is still poor accessibility. Additionally, sometimes poor accessibility support in one component cannot be reasonably overcome by other components and the result is inaccessibility, making it impossible for some people with disabilities to use a particular website, page, or feature. Guidelines and Other Standards The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops web accessibility standards for the different components: Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) addresses authoring tools Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) addresses web content, and is used by developers, authoring tools, and accessibility evaluation tools User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) addresses web browsers and media players, including some aspects of assistive technologies These accessibility guidelines are based on the fundamental technical specifications of the web, and are developed in coordination with all W3C technical specifications (HTML, XML, CSS, SVG, SMIL, etc.). W3C also develops technical specifications that directly address accessibility, including: ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, which defines a way to make web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

    "text": "Summary This page describes steps to help you report website accessibility problems: Identify key contacts Describe the problem Follow-up as needed Additional tips include: Consider what approach will get the results you want Keep records of all communications for possible follow-up Encourage others to also provide feedback to the organization Use the sample emails provided below Page Contents Introduction Consider Your Approach Identify Key Contacts Describe the Problem Include Sources for More Information Request Reply Follow-Up as Needed Sample Emails Introduction This document shows you how to encourage organizations to make their website accessible. Contact organizations when you find accessibility barriers on their website. Your feedback to an organization can help them improve their website’s accessibility. This will benefit you, other people who use the website, and the organization itself. Website owners have many priorities for changes and improvements. The more an organization hears about accessibility from people who use their website, the more likely it is that accessibility will become a higher priority. Positive feedback is useful, as well as critical feedback. Some website owners are not even aware of the importance of making their website accessible. Websites are required to be accessible in many countries by national policies. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities states that people with disabilities have a right to access information and services via the Internet. Also, accessible websites provide business benefits for website owners and benefits for people without disabilities. Note that most accessibility barriers are caused by poor website design and development. However, some accessibility problems might be related to settings in your web browser or assistive technology. For guidance to help you customize your particular web browser and computer setup so it’s easier to use websites, see Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer. Consider Your Approach Consider what approach will get the results you want. Your tone in emails, phone calls, and other communications influences how people react and respond. Keep in mind that there are different reasons why websites are not accessible. Some organizations don’t know about accessibility and don’t know how to make their websites accessible. Some are just learning about accessibility and trying to make their website accessible, although they might not be doing it well enough yet. And there are some organizations that choose not to make their websites accessible. Often it is best when you first contact an organization to assume that they don’t know about the accessibility barriers on their website. You can adjust your approach based on their response and what you learn about the organization’s position on accessibility. Their response can help you choose follow up actions that are likely to be most effective. Asking Others to Help Consider asking for help understanding the problem and communicating it. Someone might be able to help you understand the website or assistive technologies. Someone might help you communicate to the website owners. For example, an advocacy group. Encouraging Accessible Websites Acknowledge and encourage organizations that make their websites accessible. Positive feedback can motivate individuals and organizations. It can encourage other organizations to invest in web accessibility. Identify Key Contacts Try to find the person responsible for the web page or application that is inaccessible. Or find the person responsible for accessibility at the organization. Sometimes you will have to use any contact you can find. Look for links on their website such as: Accessibility Editor, Author, Page Owner, Webmaster Contact Us, Feedback, Comments Help, Support, Customer Service, “FAQ” (frequently asked questions) Some links will be email addresses, some will go to online forms, and some will provide other ways to contact the organization. If you cannot find contacts on the website, other places to look include: telephone directory local library and librarian local business directory public companies register Describe the Problem Describe the accessibility barrier clearly. This will help the organization find and fix the problem. Include: the page where you found a problem what the problem is what computer and software you use a screenshot of the web page Where the Problem is Include the web address (also called URL), or a description of the page. Examples of a web address (URL): http://www.example.org/services/local.html https://www.example.org/checkout/confirm.php Examples of page descriptions: “the Local Services page, the one with the lists of Residential Services and Business Services” “the Confirm Purchase page after I entered my credit card information” “the Search Results from the Services Directory Database” What the Problem is Provide details about what you were trying to do, and why it was difficult or impossible to do it. Examples of problem descriptions: keyboard navigation - I can’t get from the home page to the pages for paying my bill. I can’t use a mouse so I use Tab to get to links, but I can’t tab to the Pay Your Bills link. mouse clicking - It’s hard for me to get the mouse to stop on small things. In the survey, it’s hard to click the little circles. On other surveys I’ve used, I can click on the words as well as the circles, which is a lot easier. small text - I can’t read the bus timetables because the text is too small. I set the text size to Larger in my browser, but the text didn’t get any bigger. overlapping text - I had trouble reading the small text. I increased the text size in my browser, but then much of the text overlapped other text and the pictures. This made it impossible to read. color combinations - It’s hard to read some of the product descriptions because the colors make it hard to see the text. I have problems with blue/yellow and blue/orange color combinations. alt text - I’m using a screen reader to listen to your website. Screen readers can’t read images; they read the alt text from the code. The images on this page are missing alt text. For example, I hear “240.gif” which my friend tells me is an image for Special Discounts. distracting animations - I found the home page very confusing and it was difficult to find the information I wanted with all the animated things all over the page. They kept drawing my attention away from what I was trying to read. captions - I was told there are good video tutorials on your website. But I cannot get much information from the videos because I can’t hear them. They videos are missing captions. What Computer and Software You are Using Provide details about your computer and software. If you don’t know, maybe a friend, relative, or colleague can help you find that information. If not, you can skip this part. Include: the operating system you are using, and the version (for example, Windows 10, macOS 10.13, or Linux Ubuntu 17.10) the browser software you use to view the Web, and the version (for example, Edge, Internet Explorer (IE) 11, Firefox 60, Chrome 62.0, Opera 45, Safari 10.1.2, etc.) Also include the following information if it relates to the problem you are having: any settings you have customized (for example, I set the Font Size to Largest in my browser) any assistive technology that you use (for example, screen reader, screen magnification software, voice recognition software for input) Examples of detailed computer and software descriptions: I use Windows 10 with Internet Explorer 11 and Tazti voice recognition software I use the NVDA screen reader version 2017.2 with Windows 10 Home edition and the Firefox browser version 60 Even if you don’t know all the details, include what you do know. Examples of simple descriptions: I use a Mac with the Safari browser and set the Universal Access to never use fonts smaller than 14. I use Windows with Edge. I changed the Windows colors to give me yellow text on a black background as it’s easier to read. I use the Opera browser with Windows and I use keystrokes to navigate websites. (I can’t use a mouse at all.) Note: Do not reveal personal information such as passwords, via email or otherwise. Do not provide any information that you are not comfortable disclosing. Include Sources for More Information Help the organization understand web accessibility issues. Consider including the following resources: Introduction to Web Accessibility https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ How People with Disabilities Use the Web https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ Request Reply Ask the organization to reply to you. If you are comfortable giving your phone number, include your number in case they want to discuss the problem. Follow-Up as Needed Responsible organizations will follow up with you. However, sometimes you might need to follow up with them. Be Available for Follow-up The website developers might need more information from you to help them diagnose and fix the problem. Keep Records for Further Follow-Up You might need records if you later decide to take further action. In particular: Keep copies of the website when you first encounter the problem. For example, take screenshots, save the pages on your hard drive, or print the pages. If the website changes, make new copies of it. Keep printed or electronic copies of all correspondence, including email, postal mail, and online forms. Keep records of all phone calls. Include the dates, the names of who you talked with, and notes on what was said. Getting a Response You might get a quick response, or it might take longer to hear back. It depends on the organization’s culture, policies, and internal systems. You might get an automatic reply that the organization received your feedback. The organization should follow up later with a direct reply to your issue. Sometimes the organization does not have expertise in accessibility. They may not understand your feedback. They might assume the issue is with your browser or assistive technology. The organization might fix the problem and not notify you. If you do not receive satisfactory responses within a reasonable timeframe, consider taking further action, described below. Further Action to Consider If you feel the organization is not adequately resolving the accessibility problem, consider taking further action. For example: Contact an advocacy group to see if they will get involved. Contact the organization’s senior management, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Managing Director, or Chief Business Officer. Use online community resources, such as blogging or social networking, to tell others about the inaccessible website. Share what the organization did in response to your contact. Contact the press or write a “letter to the editor”. Starting a petition (maybe online). If it is a government website, contact your local government. Lodge a formal complaint with the relevant industry regulator or ombudsman. Contact the government department responsible for disability rights, older people’s rights, or human rights. Consider legal action. For example, based on web accessibility requirements in anti-discrimination regulations in your country.

I recently visited your ticket offers page (http://www.cl.example.com/tickets/mank.html) looking for tickets for Thelonius Mank. I couldn’t use the page because the gray text on the black background is too hard to read. You can get information about web accessibility from the web page at https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ As I am a CityLights’ events fan, I would appreciate your attention to this problem - please let me know when it’s fixed. If you would like me to supply any further information, please email me. Regards, Maria Sample Email 2 Subject: Accessibility of Citylights' news page Hello Citylights Director, Your news page (http://www.cl.example.com/news/news.html) is not accessible. I listen to web pages with the NVDA screen reader (version 2017.2). I use Windows 10 and Internet Explorer 11. My colleague told me that you had some heat wave information so I went to the news page, however there was something strange going on. I found a sentence about the heat wave and temperatures, but then there was something about the violin case man. Much of the page seemed mixed up and was confusing for me to listen to - it appears it was not written in a linear fashion so that someone like me using a screen reader can understand it. Also, your news page doesn’t have any headings. Headings are important because I use them to get an overview of the page and to help me navigate to the stories. Please check out this web accessibility information from the W3C: Introduction to Web Accessibility https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/ How People with Disabilities Use the Web https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/ Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/ Please let me know when these problems are addressed. Thank you for your attention. Noriyuki Sample Email 3 Subject: Problem accessing Citylights' surveys Hi Citylights, Love your stories, but not your surveys! I can’t use a mouse very much because my arms don’t work well. Usually I tab around web pages. Anyway, on your survey page I was only able to get to the question about how many cars we have when I tabbed around. When I did try using the mouse to answer the ‘where do I live’ question, I couldn’t click on the words like I can on many other sites’ forms, I had to click the little circle before the words. In case it helps you diagnose and fix the problem: I have a Win10 laptop and use Chrome browser Version 60.0.3112.78. To learn more about these and other accessibility issues, check out www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility By the way, making your site accessible will benefit Citylights too, see Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization (www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview.html). Please tell me when you’ve fixed these problems. Happy to help you further. You can ring me at 12-345-6789. Best, Jasmine [CC: Spinal Cord Injury Association]",

    "text": "Page Contents To Zoom In or Out Why doesn’t this work with some other websites? For a Plain Layout View Other Text and Color Changes Should all websites include instructions like this? Note: No Browser Endorsement Related Pages The WAI website is designed to let you change the text size, text and background colors, and other display settings through standard browser settings. This page shows you how to use some of these browser display settings. “Why doesn’t this work with some other Web sites?” explains that these settings may not work on browsers and Web sites that do not meet accessibility guidelines. “Should all sites include this?” explains that including these instructions is not an accessibility requirement. To Zoom In or Out Most web browsers include functionality that allows for an increase or decrease text and content in web pages via a feature called browser zoom. Some browsers also give control for text-only size adjustments. Additionally, there are a number of browser extensions or add-ons that provide users additional control over the display of content. Most commonly, the commands to increase or decrease zoom levels in browsers are: Windows, Linux, and Chrome OS: Ctrl and + or Ctrl and - (pressing Ctrl and the plus button or Ctrl and the minus button simultaneously) Mac OS: ⌘ and + or ⌘ and + (pressing command and the plus button or command and the minus button simultaneously) Browser vendors have specific, detailed, and updated guides available for changing the zoom and/or text display sizes. We have collected links to some of these resources for your convenience. Mozilla Firefox - Font size and zoom Google Chrome - Change text, image, and video sizes (zoom) Microsoft Edge - is there an official MS page for Edge's zoom feature? Safari - Zoom in on webpages Internet Explorer - Ease of access options Opera - Zoom Vivaldi - Zooming options in Vivaldi Why doesn’t this work with some other websites? The browser settings on this page should work when browsers and websites meet WAI guidelines and are designed for accessibility, flexibility, and user control. However, some browsers do not provide as much user control, and some websites are designed to defeat browser settings. Text resizing does not work well in browsers and websites that do not meet accessibility guidelines. In Internet Explorer Version 6 and earlier, the text may not resize because the Web site is designed with “hard-coded” or “absolute” text sizes. To override Web site setting: Menu items: Tools ▶ Internet Options In Internet Options dialog box: Accessibility button (bottom right) In Accessibility dialog box: [/] Ignore colors specified on Web pages [/] Ignore font styles specified on Web pages [/] Ignore font sizes specified on Web pages In Firefox early versions, the text should resize even if the Web site text is not “coded” for flexibility. However the sections of the Web site may not resize, making it difficult to use the site with large text. This is because the Web site was designed with “hard-coded” or “absolute” sizes. Firefox does not resize images. Opera resizes all aspects of a Web site, including font, images, and sections. Resizing should work fairly well in Opera, even if the Web site is not “coded” for flexibility. For a Plain Layout View Turning off the style sheet gives a plain layout view, which: makes text black on a white background (or however your browser is set) puts all the information in one column (called “linearized”) leaves content images removes background images Browser Example Menu Items Firefox View ▶ Page Style ▶ No Style Opera View ▶ Style ▶ User Mode Other Text and Color Changes Many browsers provide functionality to set different aspects of font and color. Below are examples of how to access this functionality. Browser Example To access functionality: Firefox Windows Menu items:Tools ▶ Options Macintosh Menu items: Firefox ▶ Preferences In dialog box: General (in the left pane), Fonts &amp; Colors (button) Opera Windows Menu items: Tools ▶ Preferences Macintosh Menu items: Opera ▶ Preferences In dialog box: Fonts and Page Style (in the left pane) Should all websites include instructions like this? It is not an accessibility requirement that websites include information on changing text sizes and colors like this page. WAI chose to include this information to help people who want to know how to change their browser settings and may not know how. Web browsers and websites should be designed following WAI guidelines so that people can easily change text sizes and colors. Note: No Browser Endorsement W3C WAI does not endorse specific Web browsers and does not recommend one browser over another. While some common browsers are included in this page, mention of a specific browser does not imply endorsement or recommendation.

Consider the Scope You may not be able to address all the issues on every part of your website at once. To determine which parts you want to improve right away, and which to address in later stages, consider prioritizing: Key tasks, such as registration, search, submit, or checkout processes. Include all steps involved to complete each task. Key content, such as frequently accessed content and content that is relevant to people with disabilities. Reported content, that has known barriers; for example, from user comments submitted through the website feedback form. In-development content, such as areas of the website that are currently being redesigned, to avoid the creation of new barriers. Within your scope of repair, consider prioritizing what you repair first by focusing on: High-impact repairs Appear on multiple web pages, such as navigation bars Appear on frequently-used web pages, such as the home page Are critical to complete processes, such as purchase forms Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level A issues Low-effort repairs Require less time, cost, or skills to repair Requires less testing and validation Set your Accessibility Target Level The generally accepted target for accessibility is the latest version of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA. This may already be the standard specified in your organizational policy or it may be the legal requirement for your website. You may need to define a phased approach with different dates for different levels. For example, meet particular WCAG 2 success criteria in the next release, and meet all Level A and Level AA success criteria in the following release. Note that in some cases, some Level AAA success criteria may be fairly easy to meet. For example, refining appropriate link text (2.4.4, Level A) and heading structure (2.4.10, Level AAA) may be easy to address together when revising content. Tips for Efficient Repair Leverage the different skills in your team — While many tasks will be for developers, other roles have plenty to contribute. For example, designers can select better colors and content authors can improve the wording of links, headings, and text alternatives. The resource Using Combined Expertise to Evaluate Web Accessibility may be helpful. Communicate requirements across your team — Ensure that everyone involved in repairs understands the basics of web accessibility and the specific requirements they need to address. Distribute the Important Resources to the relevant members of your team. Validate solutions as early as possible — Ensure that any solutions adequately address the issues raised to avoid implementing changes that do not work in practice. If at all possible, it is important to involve people with disabilities in such validation. The resources about involving users in web projects and evaluating with users provide more background. Optimize your Tools — Explore and configure accessibility settings in the authoring tools you use to create web content, such as your content management system (CMS). The resources about selecting evaluation tools and selecting authoring tools may be helpful. Longer Term: Planning and Managing Once you have addressed some of the most critical web accessibility issues on your web project, it is essential you plan to integrate accessibility throughout future design and development processes. The Planning and Managing Web Accessibility guide can help you develop that plan.",

    "title": "Accessibility, Usability, and Inclusion",
    "text": "Introduction Accessibility, usability, and inclusion are closely related aspects in creating a web that works for everyone. Their goals, approaches, and guidelines overlap significantly. It is most effective to address them together when designing and developing websites and applications. There are a few situations when it’s important to focus specifically on one aspect. For example, when developing standards and policies. Researching the accessibility needs of people with disabilities helps with developing those. This article briefly: explains the distinctions and overlaps between accessibility, usability, and inclusive design, encourages increased coordination across research and practice in these disciplines, and, points out the importance of maintaining the focus of accessibility on people with disabilities. Distinctions and Overlaps Accessibility: addresses discriminatory aspects related to equivalent user experience for people with disabilities. Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools. It also means that they can contribute equally without barriers. For more information, see the Accessibility introduction. Usability: is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Usability includes user experience design. This may include general aspects that impact everyone and do not disproportionally impact people with disabilities. Usability practice and research often does not sufficiently address the needs of people with disabilities. Inclusion: is about diversity, and ensuring involvement of everyone to the greatest extent possible. In some regions this is also referred to as universal design and design for all. It addresses a broad range of issues including: accessibility for people with disabilities; access to and quality of hardware, software, and Internet connectivity; computer literacy and skills; economic situation; education; geographic location; culture; age, including older and younger people; and language. Accessibility and Usability Accessibility primarily focuses on people with disabilities. Many accessibility requirements improve usability for everyone, especially in limiting situations. For example, providing sufficient contrast benefits people using the web on a mobile device in bright sunlight or in a dark room. Captions benefit people in noisy and in quiet environments. Some people have age-related functional limitations, and may not identify these as “disability”. Accessibility addresses these situations too. Accessibility includes: Requirements that are technical and relate to the underlying code rather than to the visual appearance. For example, they ensure that websites work well with assistive technologies. This includes screen readers that read aloud content, and screen magnifiers that enlarge content. Voice recognitition software used to input text is another form of assistive technology. These aspects are typically not a focus of usability research and practice. Requirements that relate to user interaction and visual design. Inadequate design can cause significant barriers for people with disabilities. That is why they are included. For example, understandable instructions and feedback for website forms and applications is good usability. They also help people with cognitive and learning disabilities. Without such requirements, some people with disabilities may be excluded from using the Web. There is a significant overlap between accessibility and usability. ISO 9241-11, defines usability as: The “extent to which a product can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals effectively, efficiently and with satisfaction in a specified context of use”. This could address accessibility when: “specified users” includes people with a range of disabilities, and “specified context of use” includes accessibility considerations such as assistive technologies. But usability practice and research often does not consider the needs of people with disabilities. Accessibility and Inclusion Several accessibility requirements also benefit people and situations that are a focus of inclusive design. For example, Web Accessibility Benefits People With and Without Disabilities describes accessibility benefits for: people with low literacy or not fluent in the language, people with low bandwidth connections or using older technologies, new and infrequent users, and, mobile device users. However, accessibility focuses on disability and does not try to address broader issues. Other efforts, such as internationalization, address other inclusion issues. Keeping accessibility focused on disabilities encourages research and development on the specific needs of people with disabilities, and solutions that are optimized for these specific needs. Accessible Design There are guidelines, standards, and techniques for web accessibility, such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which is the international standard ISO/IEC 40500. Yet when designers, developers, and project managers approach accessibility as a checklist to meet these standards, the focus is only on the technical aspects of accessibility. As a result, the human interaction aspect is often lost, and accessibility is not achieved. Combining accessibility standards and usability processes with real people ensures that web design is technically and functionally usable by people with disabilities. This is referred to as usable accessibility or accessible user experience (UX). Usable Accessibility Web designers and developers can use usability processes, methods, and techniques, to address the user interface component of accessibility. While the considerations of people with disabilities are not always included in common practices, they can be easily integrated into user experience design. A key aspect is incorporating real people in design: Ensuring that everyone involved in web projects understands the basics of how people with disabilities use the Web, Involving users with disabilities early and throughout the design process, and Involving users in evaluating web accessibility. Accessibility standards also have an important role in accessible design. For example, understanding the basic Accessibility Principles and using them for developing and evaluating early prototypes helps the development team provide basic accessibility in the earliest stages. Addressing accessibility at later stages becomes increasingly difficult. Also, usability processes and user involvement alone cannot address all accessibility issues. Even large projects cannot cover the diversity of disabilities, adaptive strategies, and assistive technologies. Accessibility guidelines, standards, and techniques ensure that the wide range of issues are adequately covered. Conclusion Accessibility practitioners and researchers can incorporate usability techniques to improve ‘usable accessibility’. User experience designers and researchers can incorporate accessibility to make their designs work better for more people in more situations. Addressing accessibility, usability, and inclusion together can more effectively lead to a more accessible, usable, and inclusive web for everyone. Resources to help are linked throughout this page.

    "text": "Summary When websites and web tools are properly designed and coded, people with disabilities can use them. However, currently many sites and tools are developed with accessibility barriers that make them difficult or impossible for some people to use. Making the web accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and society. International web standards define what is needed for accessibility. Page Contents Accessibility in Context What is Web Accessibility Accessibility is Important for Individuals, Businesses, Society Making the Web Accessible Evaluating Accessibility Examples For More Information Related Resource Video Introduction to Web Accessibility and W3C Standards (4 minutes) Accessibility in Context The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect. Tim Berners-Lee, W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people, whatever their hardware, software, language, location, or ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability. Thus the impact of disability is radically changed on the Web because the Web removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face in the physical world. However, when websites, applications, technologies, or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the Web. Accessibility is essential for developers and organizations that want to create high-quality websites and web tools, and not exclude people from using their products and services. What is Web Accessibility Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities can use them. More specifically, people can: perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web contribute to the Web Web accessibility encompasses all disabilities that affect access to the Web, including: auditory cognitive neurological physical speech visual Web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities, for example: people using mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens, different input modes, etc. older people with changing abilities due to ageing people with “temporary disabilities” such as a broken arm or lost glasses people with “situational limitations” such as in bright sunlight or in an environment where they cannot listen to audio people using a slow Internet connection, or who have limited or expensive bandwidth For a 7-minute video with examples of how accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for everyone in a variety of situations, see: Web Accessibility Perspectives Video (YouTube) More Info on What is Accessibility When you want to learn more about how different disabilities affect Web use, and read about scenarios of people with disabilities using the Web, see How People with Disabilities Use the Web. If you want more examples of benefits for others, with WCAG to back it up, see Web Accessibility Benefits People With and Without Disabilities and Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities. Accessibility is Important for Individuals, Businesses, Society The Web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. It is essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and equal opportunity to people with diverse abilities. Access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, is defined as a basic human right in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN CRPD). The Web offers the possibility of unprecedented access to information and interaction for many people with disabilities. That is, the accessibility barriers to print, audio, and visual media can be much more easily overcome through web technologies. Accessibility supports social inclusion for people with disabilities as well as others, such as: older people people in rural areas people in developing countries There is also a strong business case for accessibility. Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization (SEO). Accessible websites can have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, increased audience reach, and demonstrate corporate social responsibility (CSR). Web accessibility is required by law in many situations. More Info on Accessibility is Important Details on business benefits are in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization. Guidance on figuring out legal requirements is in Legal and Policy Factors. Making the Web Accessible Web accessibility depends on several components working together, including web technologies, web browsers and other \"user agents\", authoring tools, and websites. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) develops technical specifications, guidelines, techniques, and supporting resources that describe accessibility solutions. These are considered international standards for web accessibility; for example, WCAG 2.0 is also an ISO standard: ISO/IEC 40500. More Info on Making the Web Accessible More about these aspects of accessibility working together is in Essential Components of Web Accessibility. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), ARIA for Accessible Rich Internet Applications, and other important resources are introduced in W3C Accessibility Standards Overview. To learn more about how W3C WAI develops material through multi-stakeholder, international participation and how you can contribute, see About WAI and Participating in WAI. Making Your Website Accessible Most of the basics of accessibility are fairly easy to implement. If you are new to accessibility, it takes some time and effort to learn the common issues and solutions. Some accessibility barriers are more complicated to avoid. Some accessibility solutions take more time and effort to implement. It is most efficient and effective to incorporate accessibility from the very beginning of projects and throughout organizations. More Info on Making Your Website Accessible For an introduction to accessibility requirements and international standards, see Accessibility Principles. To understand some common accessibility barriers from the perspective of testing, see Easy Checks - A First Review. For some basic considerations on designing, writing, and developing for accessibility, see Tips for Getting Started. When you're ready to know more about developing and designing, you'll probably use resources such as: How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) Web Accessibility Tutorials For project management and organizational considerations, see Planning and Managing Web Accessibility. If you need to make quick fixes now, see Approaches for Interim Repairs. Evaluating Accessibility When developing or redesigning a website, evaluate accessibility early and throughout the development process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them. Simple steps, such as changing settings in a browser, can help you evaluate some aspects of accessibility. Comprehensive evaluation to determine if a website meets all accessibility guidelines takes more effort. There are evaluation tools that help with evaluation. However, no tool alone can determine if a site meets accessibility guidelines. Knowledgeable human evaluation is required to determine if a site is accessible. More Info on Evaluating Accessibility Resources to help with accessibility evaluation are described in Evaluating Websites for Accessibility. Examples Alternative Text for Images Images should include equivalent alternative text (alt text) in the markup/code. If alt text isn't provided for images, the image information is inaccessible, for example, to people who cannot see and use a screen reader that reads aloud the information on a page, including the alt text for the visual image. When equivalent alt text is provided, the information is available to people who are blind, as well as to people who turn off images (for example, in areas with expensive or low bandwidth). It's also available to technologies that cannot see images, such as search engines. Keyboard Input Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users with limited fine motor control. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; it makes all functionality available from a keyboard. Then people with disabilities can use assistive technologies that mimic the keyboard, such as speech input. Transcripts for Audio Just as images aren't available to people who can't see, audio files aren't available to people who can't hear. Providing a text transcript makes the audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing, as well as to search engines and other technologies that can't hear. It's easy and relatively inexpensive for websites to provide transcripts. There are also transcription services that create text transcripts in HTML format.

Page Contents Introduction Who ACT is for What is in ACT Objectives of ACT Status of ACT Rules Format 1.0 Who develops ACT Additional information Introduction The purpose of the Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) effort is to establish and document rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards, such as Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). These test rules address automated, semi-automated, and manual testing. The ACT Task Force aims to make accessibility testing transparent, and thus minimize confusion caused by different interpretations of accessibility guidelines. Who ACT is for The primary audience of Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) is developers of accessibility evaluation methodologies and tools. They implement ACT Rules into their products and services. ACT serves as documentation and requirements. A secondary audience is accessibility experts. They often assist in setting an organization’s accessibility policy, and it is important for them to know what the rules do. Who ACT is not for: Users of accessibility tools (web developers, content authors, QA testers, etc.) are not expected to read ACT. What is in ACT Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0 defines the requirements for testing rules, to guide the developers of ACT Rules Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Repository provides a set of vetted testing rules following the ACT Rules Format specification Objectives of ACT Establish consensus interpretation of accessibility requirements (Primarily WCAG) around a core set of test rules — currently there are varying and often contradictory interpretations of WCAG, which causes confusion and slows down the implementation of web accessibility Provide transparency and comparability of test tools and implementations — currently test tools employ their own often proprietary interpretations of WCAG, making test results difficult to interpret, combine, and compare Enable increased tool support by documenting structured testing procedures — establishing a common base of test rules allows tool developers to focus on increasing tool support, to reduce the amount of manual testing required Status of ACT Rules Format 1.0 Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules Format 1.0 is currently a Working Draft. ACT Rule implementations of this specification are currently in development. Technical document format The ACT Rules Format follows the W3C format for technical specifications, which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. Most WAI specifications have a link at the top to the Table of Contents. Who develops ACT ACT Task Force of the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (AG WG) develops the normative ACT Rules Format specification and supporting materials needed to implement the standard. The auto-WCAG Community Group develops non-normative test rules according to the normative specification.

    "text": "Summary This page introduces the WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications suite of web standards. Quick links to resources: WAI-ARIA User Agent Implementation Guide FAQ - including What is the current status of WAI-ARIA development? Page Contents Introduction Making Ajax and Related Technologies Accessible Versions 1.0, 1.1, future Who develops WAI-ARIA Introduction WAI-ARIA, the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite, defines a way to make Web content and Web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. It especially helps with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. Currently certain functionality used in Web sites is not available to some users with disabilities, especially people who rely on screen readers and people who cannot use a mouse. WAI-ARIA addresses these accessibility challenges, for example, by defining new ways for functionality to be provided to assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, developers can make advanced Web applications accessible and usable to people with disabilities. This page describes the problems that WAI-ARIA addresses, and introduces the WAI-ARIA suite of technical documents. Many of the terms used in this page—including Web content, user agents, and assistive technology—are described in Introduction to Web Accessibility and Essential Components of Web Accessibility. Additional information is available in: Blog post Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 is a W3C Recommendation Press release: W3C’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.0 Expands Accessibility of the Open Web Platform WAI-ARIA FAQ answers questions such as: “What happens in current and older browsers when WAI-ARIA is implemented?” and “As a Web content developer, what should I do with WAI-ARIA now?” Making Ajax and Related Technologies Accessible Figure 1: Tree control Web sites are increasingly using more advanced and complex user interface controls, such as tree controls for Web site navigation like the example in Figure 1. To provide an accessible user experience to people with disabilities, assistive technologies need to be able to interact with these controls. However, the information that the assistive technologies need is not available with most current Web technologies. Another example of an accessibility barrier is drag-and-drop functionality that is not available to users who use a keyboard only and cannot use a mouse. Even relatively simple Web sites can be difficult if they require an extensive amount of keystrokes to navigate with only a keyboard. Many Web applications developed with Ajax (also known as AJAX), DHTML, and other technologies pose additional accessibility challenges. For example, if the content of a Web page changes in response to user actions or time- or event-based updates, that new content may not be available to some people, such as people who are blind or people with cognitive disabilities who use a screen reader. WAI-ARIA addresses these accessibility challenges by defining how information about this functionality can be provided to assistive technology. With WAI-ARIA, an advanced Web application can be made accessible and usable to people with disabilities. Technical Solutions More specifically, WAI-ARIA provides a framework for adding attributes to identify features for user interaction, how they relate to each other, and their current state. WAI-ARIA describes new navigation techniques to mark regions and common Web structures as menus, primary content, secondary content, banner information, and other types of Web structures. For example, with WAI-ARIA, developers can identify regions of pages and enable keyboard users to easily move among regions, rather than having to press Tab many times. WAI-ARIA also includes technologies to map controls, Ajax live regions, and events to accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs), including custom controls used for rich Internet applications. WAI-ARIA techniques apply to widgets such as buttons, drop-down lists, calendar functions, tree controls (for example, expandable menus), and others. WAI-ARIA provides Web authors with the following: Roles to describe the type of widget presented, such as “menu”, “treeitem”, “slider”, and “progressmeter” Roles to describe the structure of the Web page, such as headings, regions, and tables (grids) Properties to describe the state widgets are in, such as “checked” for a check box, or “haspopup” for a menu. Properties to define live regions of a page that are likely to get updates (such as stock quotes), as well as an interruption policy for those updates—for example, critical updates may be presented in an alert dialog box, and incidental updates occur within the page Properties for drag-and-drop that describe drag sources and drop targets A way to provide keyboard navigation for the Web objects and events, such as those mentioned above Versions 1.0, 1.1, future WAI-ARIA 1.0 was published as a completed W3C Recommendation on 20 March 2014. WAI-ARIA 1.1 is expected to include only a few changes from 1.0. [Most potential changes will be considered for WAI-ARIA 2.0.]{.listintro} The latest status is updated in the FAQ: What is the current status of WAI-ARIA development? WAI-ARIA 1.1 The 1.1 version will extend WAI-ARIA 1.0 to provide a small number of features to complete the HTML + ARIA accessibility model. It is intended complement HTML 5.1. For 1.1, user agent implementation guidance is provided as a suite of accessbility API mapping specifications that describe how to expose semantics of WAI-ARIA and other web content languages to accessibility APIs. Published WAI-ARIA 1.1 Working Drafts are as follows: WAI-ARIA 1.1 technical specification, provides features to define accessible user interface elements and in order to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. It is primarily for developers of Web browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents; developers of Web technologies (technical specifications); and developers of accessibility evaluation tools. Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module 1.0, extends WAI-ARIA 1.1 to define an ontology of roles, states, and properties specific to digital publishing. It facilitates automated processing and accessibility support by providing semantics that are not included in base languages such as HTML. It allows authors to convey structural information to assistive technologies, and to enable semantic navigation, styling, and interactive features used by readers. Graphics WAI-ARIA Module 1.0, extends WAI-ARIA 1.1 to allow an author to express the logical structure of the graphic to assistive technologies. Assistive technologies could then enable semantic navigation and adapt styling and interactive features, to provide an optimal experience for the audience. Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1, describes how user agents should expose semantics of web content languages to accessibility APIs. The core module defines support that applies across multiple content technologies, including general keyboard navigation support and mapping of general-purpose WAI-ARIA features; other specifications will extend this for specific technologies. Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1, describes how user agents determine names and descriptions of accessible objects from web content languages and expose them in accessibility APIs. This allows assistive technologies to associate and relay the name or description of objects to users. Digital Publishing Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, extends Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 to define how user agents map roles in the Digital Publishing WAI-ARIA Module to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). HTML Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, extends Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 and Accessible Name and Description: Computation and API Mappings 1.1 to define how user agents map HTML markup to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). Provides HTML-specific guidance for how the HTML user agent must respond to keyboard focus, native HTML features, and role, state and property attributes provided via WAI-ARIA. SVG Accessibility API Mappings 1.0, extends Core Accessibility API Mappings 1.1 to define how user agents map SVG markup to platform accessibility application programming interfaces (APIs). When supported by user agents, its features allow SVG authors to create accessible rich internet applications, including charts, graphs, and other drawings. Provides SVG-specific guidance for how the SVG user agent must respond to keyboard focus, native SVG features, and role, state and property attributes provided via WAI-ARIA. WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1, recommends approaches to help web application developers make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties. It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the WAI-ARIA specification which is oriented primarily at user agent implementers. Additional documents are expected in this suite, including other accessibility API mappings and updated authoring guidance. Editors’ drafts under development can be accessed in the WAI-ARIA GitHub Repository. WAI-ARIA 1.0 In-progress “Editors’ Drafts” of the WAI-ARIA documents are available from the Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) Working Group. Published WAI-ARIA Working Drafts are as follows: WAI-ARIA technical specification, a completed W3C Recommendation Web standard, combines the two previously-published WAI-ARIA draft specifications: Roles for Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA Roles) and the States and Properties Module for Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA States and Properties). It is primarily for developers of Web browsers, assistive technologies, and other user agents; developers of Web technologies (technical specifications); and developers of accessibility evaluation tools. WAI-ARIA User Agent Implementation Guide, a completed W3C Recommendation Web standard, describes how browsers and other user agents should support WAI-ARIA; specifically, how to expose WAI-ARIA features to platform accessibility APIs. WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices, describes how Web content developers can develop accessible rich internet applications using WAI-ARIA. It provides detailed advice and examples directed primarily to Web application developers, yet also useful to user agent and assistive technology developers. This document has been retired and replaced by WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1. WAI-ARIA Primer introduces developers to the accessibility problems that WAI-ARIA is intended to solve, the fundamental concepts, and the technical approach of WAI-ARIA. This document has been retired and replaced by WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1. WAI-ARIA Roadmap defines the path to make rich Web content accessible, including steps already taken, remaining future steps, and a timeline. Much of the content from previous drafts of the Roadmap has been moved to the WAI-ARIA Primer. W3C Recommendations and Working Group Notes are briefly explained in How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process, which also describes milestones in the W3C Process. Technical document format The WAI-ARIA documents follow the W3C format for technical specifications which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. Who develops WAI-ARIA The WAI-ARIA technical documents are developed by the Accessible Rich Internet Applications Working Group (ARIA WG), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). For more information about the working group, see the ARIA WG public page. How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute describes formal periods for public review. Opportunities for review and comment of WAI documents are announced on the WAI home page and WAI Interest Group mailing list.

Page Contents Who EARL is for What is in EARL What is the status of EARL Who develops EARL The Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) is a machine-readable format for expressing test results. The primary motivation for developing EARL is to facilitate the processing of test results, such as those generated by web accessibility evaluation tools, using a vendor-neutral and platform-independent format. Web authoring tools and quality assurance software can use EARL to aggregate test results obtained from different testing tools including web accessibitity evaluation tools, validators, and other types of content checkers. EARL uses the Resource Description Framework (RDF) to define the terms for expressing test results. Who EARL is for EARL is primarily intended for developers of: Web accessibility evaluation tools Web quality assurance and validation tools Web authoring and development tools Web content description and labeling frameworks What is in EARL EARL is an RDF vocabulary, the terms of which are defined by the following specifications: Evaluation And Report Language (EARL) 1.0 Schema - defines the core schema for EARL. Developer Guide for Evaluation And Report Language (EARL) 1.0 - describes the motivations for EARL and provide a tutorial introduction on how to use the terms. HTTP Vocabulary in RDF 1.0 - provides terms to record HTTP exchanges between a client and a server in RDF. Representing Content in RDF 1.0 - provides terms to represent content (such as HTTP body entities) in RDF. Pointer Methods in RDF 1.0 - provides terms for representing pointers - entities that permit identifying a portion or segment of a piece of content. Requirements for the Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) 1.0 - describes the requirements for the scope, design, and features of EARL. EARL 1.0 reuses other RDF terms such as those provided by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the Friend Of A Friend (FOAF) project. EARL terms can also be reused for other purposes, such as for content description and content labeling.

A user agent that follows UAAG 2.0 will improve accessibility through its own user interface and its ability to communicate with other technologies, including assistive technologies (software that some people with disabilities use to meet their requirements).

UAAG is part of a series of accessibility guidelines, including the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG WG) and the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). Essential Components of Web Accessibility explains the relationship between the different guidelines. Who UAAG is for UAAG is primarily for developers of Web browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers and other applications that render web content. UAAG and supporting resources are also intended to meet the needs of many different audiences, including policy makers, managers, and others. For example: People who want to choose user agents that are more accessible can use UAAG to evaluate user agents People who want to encourage their existing user agent developer to improve accessibility in future versions can file bugs against UAAG or can refer the user agent vendor to UAAG. UAAG 2.0 UAAG 2.0 was developed to help make future generations of Web browsers more accessible, to provide alternative information based on the users technology and platform, and to align with WCAG 2.0 and ATAG 2.0. UAAG 2.0 is complete. It provides specific guidance for browsers and other user agents, and reference information for accessibility professionals. The User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG) has identified implementations of the features (“success criteria”) of UAAG 2.0, demonstrating that it is possible to implement the UAAG 2.0 success criteria. The threshold for a specification becoming a formal W3C Recommendation ordinarily involves extensive formal testing of implementations of each success criteria across multiple user agents – which in the case of UAAG 2.0 would have required manual testing of many browser user interfaces. Sufficient testing resources were not available for this level of testing. W3C does not currently plan to advance UAAG 2.0 to Recommendation status. W3C plans to include user agent accessibility considerations in future accessibility guidelines work. UAAG 2.0 is still needed and relevant, and may be increasingly relevant in the future. The work of the current task forces for Mobile Accessibility and Low Vision Accessibility show the importance of combined consideration of content, user interface, extensions, applications and user agents. While many of the UAAG 2.0 features are supported in individual browsers, there is a need for more consistent and reliable support for accessibility features across all browsers and user agents. UAAG 2.0 provides specific accessibility guidance for user agent developers who want to build a better user experience for all. We recommend that you use UAAG 2.0. UAAG 2.0 Supporting Documents UAAG 2.0 Reference: Explanations, Examples, and Resources for User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 provides supporting information for those using UAAG 2.0. Each UAAG 2.0 success criterion is explained with the intent of the success criterion, examples, additional resources, where it is typically implemented and what aspect of the user agent it applies to. The Mobile Accessibility Examples are a subset of the UAAG 2.0 Reference. These examples (or use cases) highlight how UAAG can help people with disabilities who are using mobile devices. UAAG 1.0 User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 was approved in December 2002 Who develops UAAG UAAG technical documents are developed by the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (UAWG), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). For more information about the working group, see the UAWG page. The UAWG is closed as of January 2016. How WAI Develops Accessibility Guidelines through the W3C Process: Milestones and Opportunities to Contribute describes formal periods for public review. Opportunities for review and comment of WAI documents are announced on the WAI home page and WAI Interest Group mailing list. An email address for sending comments is included in the “Status of this Document” section. Opportunities for contributing to UAAG and other WAI work are introduced in Participating in WAI.",

Note this includes web applications developed solely for mobile platform delivery. 2. Policy statement All new and redesigned web content published after the effective date of this policy by ACME Inc, both for public and internal websites and services, will conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria. All existing web content published prior to the effective date of this policy will either be archived or modified to conform to WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria. Web content hosted on ACME Inc. public websites will be addressed no later than August, 20XX. Web content hosted on internal websites will be addressed no later than September, 2016. All internal content management systems (CMS) and web content authoring tools will conform to ATAG Level AA success criteria by Jan, 2016. Where websites, services, or applications provide users with the opportunity to generate content, the interfaces provided will conform to ATAG Level AA. All internal user agents will conform to UAAG Level AA success criteria by Jan, 2016. Where user agents are used as part of a website, service, or application, such as a media player, they will conform with UAAG Level AA success criteria by Oct, 20XX. This policy does not stipulate any particular technology or design approach. The aim is to maximize access to and use of ACME Inc. websites by people with disabilities. 3. Need for policy The June 2011 World Health Organization (WHO) Report on Disability estimated that there are a billion people with disabilities. Many of these disabilities can affect access to information technologies, and/or can benefit from the use of information technologies including the Web. Accessibility of the Web is of critical importance to people with disabilities around the world, including people with auditory, cognitive, physical, neurological, and visual disabilities, and is likewise important to those with accessibility needs due to aging. Providing accessible web content can also benefit people who do not have disabilities but who are experiencing situational barriers. For instance, when accessing the Web from devices with small screens or in low bandwidth situations, or when experiencing barriers due to language or literacy levels, accessibility solutions can also support improved access. ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. As potential customers and employees they are important contributor to ACME Inc. business success and should not be excluded. As a consequence of this policy, ACME Inc. will meet its legal obligations as defined by the @@@@. 4. Responsibilities Accessibility Coordinator Consolidate annual status reports for presentation to the board at annual review meeting. Prepare and provide accessibility training and guidance. Promote web accessibility awareness internally. Respond to user enquiries related to web accessibility. Organize on-going assessment of the accessibility of websites, content, services, and applications identified as in scope. Web project managers Ensure compliance with this policy. Prepare project accessibility report at key project stages; analysis, design, development, and QA. Ensure user feedback mechanisms are included as part of project deliverables. Ensure all staff receive appropriate and regular accessibility training. ICT department and webmasters Choose and implement tools that conform to this policy. Provide tools to support in automated accessibility checking. Remedy identified accessibility barriers. Web content management teams Ensure all staff receive appropriate and regular accessibility training. Ensure submitted content is compliant with this policy. Fix identified accessibility issues in authored web content. 5. Exclusions Web content that has been archived is not subject to the standards referenced in this policy. Should there be a specific request for access to archived content by any individual with a disability, that content will be made available in a suitable format within 10 business days. Where it is not technically possible to make the content available, a suitable alternative should be agreed with the individual. The department or team responsible for the creation of the content is responsible for making it accessible. 6. Procurement This policy applies to all web content developed by or for ACME Inc. This policy should be referenced within any contract of services or statements of work for web content, websites, services, or applications. Any contract must include provision for an independent statement of conformance stating that the work meets the required standard. This should form part of the deliverables approval process. 7. Syndicated content Elements of ACME Inc. websites might include web content syndicated from other providers. For example, a social media stream. When considering a syndication service for inclusion in any of ACME Inc. websites, any service review should include an evaluation of the accessibility of the service. Such evaluations must form a part of the service selection criteria. Where a service is selected with known accessibility issues, ACME Inc. will develop or procure a solution that ensures the content delivered via ACME Inc. websites meets the policy standards. 8. Reporting Each department with responsibility for web content, websites, services, or applications must submit an annual status report to the Accessibility Coordinator. The status report will summarize the efforts and progress towards the aims defined by this policy. 9.

    "title": "Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Summary This page helps you develop a policy for creating, managing, and delivering accessible websites. To learn about how such policies form part of a broader approach to implementing accessibility, see Planning and Managing Web Accessibility. Page Contents Reference standards Define conformance levels Define scope of policy Set conformance milestones Consider third-party content Define monitoring and review process Example policies Policy template Next steps: Maintaining your policy Longer term: Strategic planning Designing a policy Your web accessibility policy may be standalone or integrated into other policies. The accessibility policy could be part of a non-discrimination or equal opportunity policy. Other related documents should also mention web accessibility. For example, brand guidelines, coding standards, and project management frameworks. This helps considering accessibility as a core feature, rather than an afterthought. Your organizational policy may not be suitable for the public if it is an internal document. Consider providing a public accessibility statement that reflects your policy, goals, and achievements. This will communicate your efforts towards improving accessibility. Example of simple policy ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring that its website is accessible to people with disabilities. All the pages on our website will meet W3C WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, Level AA conformance. Report any issues to accessibility@acme.inc. Reference standards Reference specific standards in policy documents to ensure clear criteria for accessibility. The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) provides a set of accessibility standards that are commonly recognized by governments and organizations from around the world. These include: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) applies to all web content and applications. This includes content on mobile, television, and other delivery channels. The WCAG Overview provides more background. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) applies to websites that provide users the opportunity to generate content. For example, adding comments, posting to forums, or uploading images or videos. ATAG is also relevant if your organization provides tools, such as CMS’s, for staff or customers to manage websites and content. The ATAG Overview provides more background. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) applies when additional plugins are provided to deliver additional content. Media players are a good example of this. UAAG also applies when custom controls are used to provide non-standard functionality. UAAG may also be relevant where mobile applications deliver web content as part of the application. It may also be relevant to the procurement process if your organization provides browsers for staff. The UAAG Overview provides more background. Referencing Approaches As technologies and standards continually evolve, it is important to keep policies current. The text of policies that include accessibility requirements tend to quickly become outdated. This introduces gaps between current accessibility standards and older policies. Ideally, a policy would reference the W3C/WAI standards. It should also define a mechanism to transition to newer versions of the standards when they become available. Referencing Guidelines and Other Technical Specifications Explains options relating to referencing. Define conformance levels W3C WAI guidelines provide three levels of conformance: A, AA, and AAA. The generally accepted level of conformance in many countries is Level AA. It is critical for the success of your policy to select a conformance level you can realistically achieve. Once selected, specify what level of conformance is to be achieved for each referenced standard. Examples Simple example of referencing WCAG ACME Inc. seeks to make sure our website conforms to W3C WAI WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Example of reference to WCAG and ATAG At ACME Inc. we seek to ensure all of our websites and web applications, conform to all Level AA success criteria of W3C WAI WCAG 2.1. This applies to both customer-facing and for internal use. We also aim to ensure that our authoring tools conform to all Level AA criteria of ATAG. Define scope of policy Clearly state the scope of your policy, and how it applies to different parts of the websites in scope. This includes third-party, legacy, and mobile content. It also applies to applications provided as part of these websites. Your policy may apply to websites internal to the organization, such as intranets, and to websites for external audiences. It also includes the tools used to create and to access your website. Note that broader polices may impact your scope considerations. For example, public websites and services could be different from access to the workplace. Examples Simple example of content scope This policy applies to all new, updated, and existing web content on http://www.acme.inc/ and all content provided internally at http://intranet.acme.inc/. Set conformance milestones For all items in scope of your policy, define clear and measureable milestones, including dates, by which each will be met. If the policy is already achieved, then say when the content was last reviewed. Deadlines should be realistic but issues should not be left too long. In some cases, a phased approach might be appropriate. First, quickly fix significant accessibility barriers. Then implement fixes for other issues. You could do this as part of a planned maintenance update. Clearly outline any details of this type of approach in your policy. Examples Simple example of conformance milestone By February 1, 20XX, ACME Inc’s web content will meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA conformance. Example of staged conformance milestones By November 1, 20XX, ACME Inc’s websites will meet WCAG 2.1, Level A conformance. By May 1, 20XX web content will meet WCAG 2.1, Level AA conformance. Example of supplier milestone By June 1, 20XX, all vendors of content management systems (CMS) used by ACME Inc’s should provide information regarding their plans for ATAG 2.0 conformance in future versions of their software. By June 1, 20XX ACME Inc. will preferentially purchase ATAG conformant authoring tools. Consider third-party content Your accessibility policy needs to consider procured or syndicated third-party content. This is particularly relevant for third-party content that provides essential parts of a website. For example, this could include credit card payment services, video streaming channels, or online mapping services. Site owners are responsible for ensuring accessibility or for providing accessible alternatives. This is true even if site owners don’t have full control over such content and services. For example, social media feeds may need to be monitored or moderated to ensure accessibility. See the WCAG 2.1 conformance requirement for complete processes and the concept of conforming alternate version for more background. Examples Example including third-party content scope This policy applies to all web content produced or updated by ACME Inc. ACME Inc. will also ensure third-party content providers are aware of our web accessibility policy. ACME Inc. will also favor providers based on their accessibility conformance claims. Define monitoring and review process Regularly review progress towards policy goals. Update the policy when there are changes to the timescale or when you meet milestones To maintain the target level of accessibility, specify a process and schedule to review content and tools in scope. Feedback from users who might find accessibility barriers can help you identify issues. Your policy should include information on how you will gather feedback. It should also include information how how your organization will handle and respond to feedback. Examples Example simple review policy ACME Inc. will review all area of the website every year. We will use the process described at Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology. Reviews are the responsibility of the ICT department. Accessibility checks will be incorporated into the publishing workflow for all new content. Example of feedback policy Each page of the website will include a link to a form allowing users to submit feedback on the site. We will compile and consider this information during the review process. We will respond to any feedback within 48 hours of submission. Example policies Example of simple policy ACME Inc. is committed to ensuring the accessibility of its web content to people with disabilities. All of the content on our website will meet W3C WAI’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1, Level AA conformance. Report any issues should to accessibility@acme.inc. Comprehensive policies More comprehensive policies may capture broader information. For example, how to implement the policy, or who or what departments are responsible, specific exclusions. An example comprehensive policy is provided. Policy template In the template below, the [hints] in brackets are sections for you to complete. Example Policy Template [Organization name] is committed to ensuring accessibility of its website and intranet to people with disabilities. New and updated web content produced by our organization will meet [link to standard] [version number], [level of conformance], by [compliance date]. Existing web content produced by our organization will meet our standard by [existing content compliance date]. Content provided for our site by third-party developers will meet [third-party content standard] [version number] by [third-party content compliance date]. This [does/does not] include user-generated content. We aim to ensure that our authoring tools and processes meet [authoring tools standard] [version number] by [authoring tools compliance date]. By [preferential purchasing date] we will preferentially purchase authoring tools that meet or exceed our web accessibility policy. We will review this policy [review period] on or before the [policy review date]. This policy was last reviewed on [last review date], by [reviewer]. Next steps: Maintaining your policy Keep your policy accurate and up to date. Regularly review your policy if it includes milestones. This is also true if it references particular standards by version number. Reviews should check that milestones have been met. It should also check if changes are required due to new or updated standards. You may need to adjust your policy’s scope if you have new content. You may also need to adjust the scope if you make significant changes to the structure of your website. Changes in authoring tools or processes may also need to be thought about. Longer term: Strategic planning An accessibility policy is one part of a broader strategic approach to accessibility. Making accessibility an integral part of your web development strategy is more cost effective and efficient than considering it in isolation. You can do several things to help your organization create more accessible websites as standard. Planning and Managing Web Accessibility outlines how to integrate accessibility throughout your web development. When you plan a redesign or updates, include accessibility from the start of the project. Accessibility is cheaper when tackled at the start of a project, rather than at the end. It will also take less time and resources to include accessibility from the get-go.",

    "text": "Do you remember a time when people around you broke out in laughter, but you didn’t hear the joke? Be careful not to leave out information for some people in your audience. For example, if you say “you can read it on the slide”, you are probably excluding people who cannot see the slide. Summary This page helps you make your presentations, talks, meetings, and training accessible to all of your potential audience, including people with disabilities and others. Inclusive presentations have many benefits. Page Contents Basics (for organizers &amp; speakers) Benefits (organizers &amp; speakers) Planning the Event (organizers) Provide Accessible Material and Media (organizers &amp; speakers) Planning Your Session (speakers) Preparing Slides and Projected Material (speakers) During the Presentation (speakers) For More Information (speakers &amp; organizers) Terminology (appendix) Basics (for organizers &amp; speakers) Be open to diversity in your audience and any accessibility issues. Basically, be aware that some of your audience might not be able to: see well or at all, hear well or at all, move well or at all, speak well or at all, or understand information presented in some ways well or at all. Organizers and speakers should do things like: ensure the facility is accessible, speak clearly into the microphone, describe pertinent visuals, and other considerations listed on this page. Respect participant’s needs and be open for other accessibility issues. People might have accessibility needs that you didn’t think of. For example: Someone might need to take breaks at set times for insulin injections. Someone with Tourette syndrome might randomly shout out during a session. Someone with a physical disability who cannot take notes might need to record the session. Often speakers won’t know if participants have disabilities. For example, at a large conference where organizers didn’t ask registrants. In some cases, you might know the accessibility needs of participants ahead of time. Even then something could change. For example, a new participant could join the training at the last minute. Or someone could develop accessibility needs before the training. Make your event and your presentations fully accessible to prepare for any situation. Benefits (organizers &amp; speakers) Presentations that are accessible to people with disabilities are also inclusive to many more audiences. For example, people with different learning styles and people who are not fluent in the language. Accessible presentations also have additional benefits, such as in these situations: A live presentation with visuals is recorded and made available online as an audio podcast. During the presentation you describe the visuals. That provides the visual information to people who are blind or can’t see the visuals well during the presentation. People listening to the podcast later will also get the visual information. CART provides real-time text of the speaker and other audio. People who are deaf or hard of hearing use CART. CART also helps people who understand text better than spoken language. For example, people whose native language is different. CART output can also be used to develop a transcript. Transcripts online can increase search engine optimization (SEO) for audio and video. Transcripts also have many other benefits . For additional benefits of making online material accessible, see Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization. Planning the Event (organizers) Ask speakers and participants if they have accessibility requirements. For example, include a question on registration forms for conferences, send an email to company-internal training participants, etc. Invite participants to include specific requests. For example, someone who is hard of hearing might request seating small discussion groups in a circle to make it easier to hear people talking. Or someone with low vision might ask to sit in the front row to see the screen better. Ensure the facility and area is accessible to speakers and participants. For example, ensure the building entrance, meeting room, presentation stage, and bathrooms are accessible. (There are checklists online to help ensure a facility is accessible, such as Accessibility Checklist for Existing Facilities .) Provide accessibility information, such as the accessible routes between meeting rooms. Let speakers and participants check out the rooms in advance to suggest optimum positioning of the speaker, screen, seating, etc. Ensure adequate sound system, and arrange for microphones. Often wireless lapel microphones are best so that speakers can move around. When the audience will be commenting or asking questions, provide microphones for them. Arrange for good visibility of the speakers and interpreters. Have good lighting on their face and upper body. Avoid distracting backgrounds, such as bright sunlight or flashing light. Arrange for ALDs/hearing loops, interpreters, and/or CART writers, as needed. (Assistive listening devices (ALDs), hearing loops, or induction loops; and Computer Aided Real–Time Captioning or Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) are explained in the Terminology section.) Work with participants and service providers to ensure that important details are taken care of. For example, power and a screen are provided for CART. Or microphones and the speakers’ computer sound output is connected to the ALD/hearing loop system. Arrange for good Internet connection when needed. Sometimes you might use the Internet for providing alternative formats of materials during the presentation. For example, allowing people using screen readers or other assistive technologies to follow along with an online version of your displayed material. For remote CART, you will need a reliable connection that has enough bandwidth for transferring audio. Consider accessibility when planning the schedule. Some people need more time to get from room to room. For example, because they move slowly, or because the accessible route is longer. Schedule sufficient breaks. People might need to take care of medical needs during breaks. Keep to the schedule as much as possible, and inform participants ahead of time of any changes. Give speakers accessibility requirements and guidance. Tell speakers that you expect their material and presentations to be accessible to people with disabilities. Consider including accessibility requirements in any contracts. Consider including the link to this page (www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible) in speaker guidelines, e-mails, web pages, etc. Provide Accessible Material and Media (organizers &amp; speakers) Offer handouts, slides, and other material in accessible formats. Word processing formats are often the most flexible to meet different people’s needs. Participants might need material in alternative formats such as large print or braille. If they get the material in advance electronically, they may not need it in hard copy. Ensure slides, handouts, and other electronic material for participants is accessible. For example, provide alternative text for images and mark up headings. HTML material, such as a conference website, should meet WCAG, at least Level AA. (Preparing Slides and Projected Material below has details for speakers. Some other resources are listed under For More Information below.) Make media fully accessible — including audio and video used in sessions, and recordings of sessions provided afterwards. For example, provide captions and/or transcripts as appropriate for audio, and provide audio description for videos as needed. Guidelines for media on the web is available in WCAG; it includes specific guidance such as providing an alternative for audio-only content (like podcasts). Planning Your Session (speakers) Provide material ahead of time, if requested. Provide slides, handouts, and other material to participants, interpreters, translators, and CART writers, as needed. Make it accessible. (More about providing accessible material is above.) Work with interpreters, translators, and CART writers. Give them material in advance. Explain acronyms, terms, names, etc. that you will use. Be available to answer questions. Caption audio, or otherwise make it available. Ideally, any audio you use is also available in text, for example, videos are captioned. However, if CART is provided for your presentation, that can provide text of the audio. Consider activities. Remember potential accessibility issues with any participant activities. For example, responding to questions, arranging sticky notes, small group projects, etc. Use multiple communication methods for different learning styles. Some people can better understand verbal information. Other people can better understand pictures and diagrams. And others better understand text. Preparing Slides and Projected Material (speakers) Make text and important visuals big enough to be read even from the back of the room. This includes graphics on slides, videos, posters, and other non-electronic material. Use an easy-to-read font face. Simple fonts with consistent thickness are often easier to read from a distance. Fonts where parts of the letters are thin are harder to read. Avoid fancy fonts that are difficult to read. Use sufficient color contrast. There are guidelines for web pages that you can use to help determine sufficient contrast — even though the medium is different. See Color contrast guidelines and evaluation tools. Use appropriate background and text colors. Some suggest when presenting in a light room, to display dark text on a light background. And when presenting in a darkened room, to display light text on a dark background. Ensure that the weight of text is sufficient (for example, bold). While the medium is different, web page guidelines may help determine sufficient contrast. Refer Use appropriate background and text colors. Some suggest when presenting in a light room to display dark text on a light background. When presenting in a darkened room to display light text on a dark background. Ensure that the weight of text is sufficient (for example, bold). Make provided material accessible. If you are giving participants material, make it accessible. See provide accessible material above. An example of presentation material provided in both presentation format and web format (HTML and CSS) is linked from the top of the page after “The Benefits of WCAG 2 presentation is available in 2 formats:”. During the Presentation (speakers) Speak clearly. And avoid speaking too fast, so participants and sign language interpreters can better understand you and keep up. Use simple language. Avoid or explain jargon, acronyms, and idioms. For example, expressions such as “raising the bar” can be interpreted literally by some people with cognitive disabilities and can be confusing. Give people time to process information. Pause between topics. When you ask if anyone has questions, some people with cognitive disabilities will need extra time to form their thoughts into words. Be visible. Be visible and in good light when you talk, so participants can see your face. This helps some people hear and understand better. Be careful not to face away from the audience to read projected material, particularly if you don’t have a microphone. Use a microphone. Some people might need the audio electronically, even in a small room. This includes people using ALDs/hearing loops and remote CART writers. Note that if you ask “Can everyone hear me OK?” some people might be uncomfortable saying that they cannot. Ensure that all relevant sound is audible through the sound system. For example, if the audience doesn’t have a microphone, repeat their questions and comments into your microphone before replying. Cover all displayed text. Say all of the information that is on each slide. (This does not mean that you have to read the slide exactly as it is. It just means that you cover the visual information in what you say.) Describe pertinent parts of graphics, videos, and other visuals. Describe them to the extent needed to understand the presentation. (You usually do not need to describe decorative images.) Describe other visual information. For example, a speaker asks people to raise their hands if they make their websites fully accessible. The speaker should then describe the visual response: “About half raised their hand”. For More Information (speakers &amp; organizers) This web page addresses in-person sessions. There are additional considerations for online, remote, and virtual sessions. Details on how to make material that you give to participants accessible is beyond the scope of this document. There are resources online that provide related guidance, such as: ADOD Project links to Authoring Techniques for Accessible Office Documents, including for word processing and presentation applications Planning an Accessible Conference Interacting with People with Disabilities Information on web accessibility: Accessibility - W3C - briefly introduces web accessibility and links to more resources. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview - introduces guidelines for making web content accessible. This includes presentation material, online learning, and other material provided in web formats. Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) home page - links to guidelines/standards and a wide range of support material. Terminology (appendix) assistive technology Assistive technologies are software or equipment that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web, such as screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse. ALDs, hearing loops, induction loops Assistive listening devices (ALDs), hearing loops, and induction loops amplify sound from the speaker’s microphone. CART CART, Computer Aided Real–Time Captioning or Communication Access Realtime Translation, is when a professional types what is being said verbatim so that people can read the text output. interpreters This includes sign language interpreters, cued speech transliterators, and others.

    "title": "Selecting Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools",
    "text": "Introduction Web accessibility evaluation tools are software programs or online services that help determine if web content meets accessibility guidelines. This document highlights features of evaluation tools, and discusses different aspects to consider when selecting these tools. Links to different tools are provided in the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List. Page Contents What Evaluation Tools Can Do and Can Not Do Features of Evaluation Tools Further Considerations What Evaluation Tools Can Do and Can Not Do Web accessibility evaluation tools can help you quickly identify potential accessibility issues. You can use them through all phases of the web design and development process. Tools can provide fully-automated checks, and help you with manual review. We cannot check all accessibility aspects automatically. Human judgement is required. Sometimes evaluation tools can produce false or misleading results. Web accessibility evaluation tools can not determine accessibility, they can only assist in doing so. Features of Evaluation Tools Web accessibility evaluation tools target different audiences. This includes designers, developers, non-technical content authors, quality assurance testers, and sometimes also end-users. Tools offer different features and functionality which may help users to compare and assess web accessibility evaluation tools for their specific needs. Main Features The following features describe tools found on the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List. These can be used as filters to reduce the number of tools shown. Guidelines Different organizations and governments may require conformance with different accessibility standards, thus different tools support these standards. The W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is internationally recognized as the standard for web accessibility, and supported by most tools. Language Evaluation tools support different languages. This includes the user interface of the tools, as well as the language of the content they support (for example, for detecting language-related barriers). Type of Tool Evaluation tools can be plugins (extensions) for authoring tools and web browsers, command line tools, desktop or mobile applications, and online services. Different tools may be combined, depending on your design and development process. Supported Formats Most evaluation tools check the accessibility of HTML content. Some check other web technologies, such as WAI-ARIA, CSS, SVG, and PDF. Assists by Some web accessibility evaluation tools can be used in more than one way. The following are some common characteristics used to support the evaluation process: Reports are useful to determine the conformance of the checkpoints that can be automatically checked. Step-by-step evaluations: Wizard-based evaluation tools guide users through sequences of checks. They conduct automated checks and prompt the user to manually assess the rest. For example, a wizard-based tool may check images for alternate text. The user then evaluates how appropriate the alternate text is. In-page feedback: This feature inserts temporary icons and markup to display results of accessibility checks. They are useful to view issues in context. They are also useful to understand the relative importance of each issue. Page transformation: Transformation tools change the appearance of a site to help identify design issues. For example, the tool may show the site in text only or without color. These tools are useful to compensate for the limitations of automated testing. Automatically Checks The scope of what the evaluation tool can automatically test varies depending on the tool. Some tools check a single page, while others check entire groups of related pages. Some can also access password-restricted content. License Evaluation tools are available under a variety of license types, such as Open Source, Commercial, Enterprise, etc. Accessibility Information It is important that evaluation tools are accessible so that people with disabilities can use them. Some tools provide information on how well they support accessibility. More Detailed Features The following features are other options available in evaluation tools. Some features listed are available in the Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List under Type of Tool. Authoring Tool Plugins Such plugin tools often assist non-technical content authors to check the content they are creating directly within their authoring tools. These include MS Word, Adobe Acrobat, content management systems, as well as other tools. API Some authoring and quality assurance tools can access some evaluation tools directly. The evaluation tools offer different types of APIs to allow this interaction. Browser Plugin Such plugins may assist web designers, quality assurance testers, and evaluation experts to check content directly within the browser. Online Service Evaluation tools provide different types of online services: Online checkers often are websites where you can enter your own website’s address to get it checked. Sometimes this may also be a web service accessed through an API by authoring or quality assurance tools. Hosted services can regularly check your entire website and provide reports on improvements over time. They may also offer other solutions for enterprises. Usually these require subscription with the tool vendor. Server installation of some evaluation tools provides an integrated way to check your entire website on your internal network. They can sometimes check password-restricted or draft content. Report Format Many tools generate report formats such as HTML, CSV, PDF, XML, etc. Further Considerations There are many considerations to take into account when selecting an evaluation tool. Each organization, project, and team has differing needs for different features. Web designers could be looking for tools to analyze their design’s accessibility performance. Web developers will prefer tools that help them assess their code. Web content authors have different requirements to help them complete their tasks. An organization may need a fully automated evaluation tool to track their whole website. Another organization may only need occasional spot checks. You may want to consider the following items when selecting an evaluation tool: Organizational Structure and Development Process Development teams may gain from using a combination of evaluation tools. Using a combination of tools could meet the various team members’ needs during all stages of the project. Complexity and Size of the Web Content Some complex sites could have a lot of multimedia content. Other complex sites could use advanced technologies such as SMIL or MathML. Specialized evaluation tools may be critical for these websites. Skills and Knowledge of the Web Developers Select the tool commensurate to team’s skills. Some evaluation tools require users to have more knowledge of accessibility or code. Some tools also help to increase accessibility or code knowledge.",

    "title": "Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities",
    "text": "Summary This page describes many of the barriers that people with disabilities and people using mobile devices experience when interacting with web content, including web applications. It shows how these barriers are similarly addressed in W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Mobile Web Best Practices, and Mobile Web Application Best Practices. Background People with disabilities using computers have similar interaction limitations as people without disabilities who are using mobile devices. Both experience similar barriers when interacting with websites and web applications. There is also significant overlap between the design solutions for both. For more background, see: An introduction to the overlap between W3C guidelines for accessibility and best practices for mobile devices: Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Website Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices Introduction to Web Accessibility How People with Disabilities Use the Web A comprehensive comparison between MWBP and WCAG is provided in Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Introduction The barriers on this page are grouped under four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust. These principles lay the foundation necessary for anyone to access and use web content, as described in Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility section of Introduction to Understanding WCAG 2.0. (Mobile devices vary widely and not all the barriers are present on all models.) This page includes links to some relevant solutions in: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 Note: W3C WAI recommends using WCAG 2.0, instead of WCAG 1.0.

Furthermore, information not available to user whose browser, assistive technology, other user agent doesn’t support object. WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria: 1.1.1 Non-text content. WCAG 1.0 checkpoint: 1.1. Mobile Context: User can be billed for download volume so images might be turned off to save costs. Some mobile user agents have limited support for non-text objects so user loses information. Some user agents also shrunk images in size to fit the device’s screen which can make images meaningless. MWBP 1.0 Best Practice: NON_TEXT_ALTERNATIVES and OBJECTS_OR_SCRIPT. Text entry User has difficulty entering text so text is entered incorrectly or mistakes are made. Disabilities Context: User with motor disability (for example, partial paralysis, hand tremor, lack of sensitivity, coordination) has difficulty entering information.

Page Contents Introduction Accessibility Guidelines Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Technical Specifications Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) For Audio and Video For Evaluation Additional Information Introduction The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops international Web standards: HTML, CSS, and many more. W3C’s Web standards are called W3C Recommendations. All W3C standards are reviewed for accessibility support by the Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group. The standards and Notes (which are not standards) introduced below are particularly relevant to accessibility. Accessibility Guidelines Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including: natural information such as text, images, and sounds code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc. WCAG applies to dynamic content, multimedia, “mobile”, etc. WCAG can also be applied to non-web information and communications technologies (ICT), as described in WCAG2ICT. WCAG info: WCAG Overview WCAG 2.1 at a Glance How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) WCAG 2.0 Standard WCAG 2.1 Standard Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Authoring tools are software and services that “authors” (web developers, designers, writers, etc.) use to produce web content. For example: HTML editors, content management systems (CMS), and websites that let users add content, such as blogs and social networking sites. ATAG documents explain how to: • make the authoring tools themselves accessible, so that people with disabilities can create web content, and • help authors create more accessible web content. ATAG info: ATAG Overview ATAG at a Glance ATAG 2.0 Standard User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) User agents include browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers, and other applications that render web content. UAAG info: UAAG Overview UAAG 2.0 Note Technical Specifications Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) ARIA provides semantics so authors can convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies (such as screen readers). The ARIA specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements. The ARIA suite includes API mapping specifications that provide user agent implementation guidance. It also include modules for Graphics and Digital Publishing. ARIA info: WAI-ARIA Overview – includes a list and description of modules and API mappings WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices WAI-ARIA 1.1 Standard For Audio and Video WebVTT: The Web Video Text Tracks Format is a format for captions, text video descriptions, and other metadata that is time-aligned with audio or video content. Timed Text Markup Language is intended to be used for transcoding or exchanging timed text information among legacy distribution content formats for subtitling and captioning. For Evaluation The following resources support development of accessibility evaluation methods and tools: Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Overview — ACT establishes and documents rules for testing the conformance of web content to accessibility standards. Evaluation and Report Language (EARL) Overview — EARL is a machine-readable format for expressing test results.

    "title": "Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Abstract This document explains the key role that harmonization of standards plays in increasing the accessibility of the Web for people with disabilities. It examines how adoption of a consistent set of international technical standards, the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) guidelines for Web content, authoring tools, browsers and media players can drive more rapid progress on Web accessibility, and make the design and development of accessible Web sites more efficient. Common standards for Web content accessibility and for authoring tools encourages the development of tools that support production of accessible Web content. Likewise, the adoption of a consistent standard for browser and media player accessibility would improve access to and reinforce the accessibility of Web content, and would help ensure that accessible content will be more available through assistive technologies used by some people with disabilities. This document introduces the concept of harmonization and causes of fragmentation in the area of Web accessibility standards, and examines the impact of harmonization and fragmentation on Web developers, tool developers, and organizations. It also suggests action steps for promoting Web accessibility standards harmonization. Page Contents Overview Current Situation Consequences Action Steps Related Resources Overview In this document “standards harmonization” refers to the adoption of a consistent set of international technical standards for accessibility of: Web content browsers and media players authoring tools Around the world there is currently fragmentation – conflicting, divergent technical standards** – rather than harmonization of Web accessibility standards. While W3C’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is the most broadly adopted Web accessibility standard internationally, many countries have developed or are in the process of developing their own versions of technical guidelines or standards. Furthermore, there is sometimes one version of a guideline or standard at the national level, different versions at the provincial or state level, and yet different versions adopted by commercial, educational, and non-governmental organizations within the same country. For organizations with audiences spanning different regions or economic sectors, simply keeping track of the different requirements can be a challenge. Harmonization of Web accessibility standards is key to making an accessible Web, because it creates a unified market for authoring tools that produce conformant content. This unified market in turn drives more rapid development of improved authoring tools. Improved authoring tools make it easier to create accessible Web sites, and to repair previously inaccessible sites; for instance, by prompting for accessibility information such as alternative text for graphics, captions for audio, or summaries for data tables. Widespread availability of improved authoring tools can enable accessible design to become the prevailing design mode even for Web developers only minimally aware of the rationale for Web accessibility, or disinclined to learn guidelines and techniques for accessibility. Standards harmonization also creates a more compelling market for developers of tools used to evaluate Web content accessibility. It enables re-use of training and technical assistance resources for Web accessibility across different regions and economic sectors. Standards harmonization enables better access to information through browsers and media players, and better interoperability with specialized technologies that some people with disabilities must rely on. It enables development of information repositories containing accessible, compatible, and re-usable content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) has developed: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), which describe how to make Web content and Web sites accessible; Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), which describe how to make Web authoring tools that produce content conforming to WCAG and that are accessible for people with disabilities; User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG), which describe how to make browsers and media players accessible, and how to ensure their interoperability with assistive technologies. Together these three WAI guidelines provide mutually reinforcing solutions which result in more comprehensive and effective accessibility. W3C/WAI continues to advance these three guidelines by updating and refining them as Web technologies evolve, and is currently developing updated versions of the guidelines. Current Situation Fragmentation of Web accessibility guidelines can impact progress on Web accessibility in various ways: Changing the wording of individual provisions in accessibility guidelines often changes the technical meaning of the provisions. This in turn changes what is required to meet a given level of conformance in those guidelines. This can make it more difficult for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools (which are used to evaluate the accessibility of Web content), as they will then need to support potentially conflicting sets of implementation and evaluation techniques. Combining two or more different accessibility provisions may likewise affect the meaning of these provisions. Again, this can change what is required to meet a given level of conformance to accessibility guidelines. As above, this can increase the burden for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools, which play a key role in facilitating the production and evaluation of accessible Web content. Omitting or adding accessibility provisions likewise changes what is required to meet a given level of conformance. This may similarly make it more difficult for developers of authoring tools and evaluation tools to support the resulting reduced or expanded conformance levels. Various circumstances or beliefs in different countries and organizations can contribute to the fragmentation of Web accessibility standards. For each such factor, or “fragmentation driver,” however, there is also a good reason to promote harmonization of standards: Fragmentation Driver Reason for Harmonization A restriction on the types of standards that governments can adopt; with a belief that W3C is not an official standards body W3C is the leading standards body for the Web industry. Many governments have adopted HTML or XML, and therefore already have mechanisms whereby they can adopt W3C standards. A requirement that only standards officially available in local language(s) can be adopted W3C now allows the development of authorized translations in local languages through its Policy for Authorized W3C Translations. For example, Authorized Translations of WCAG are available in several languages. The belief that only local guidelines can meet the needs of the local disability community Disability needs with regard to Web accessibility do not vary significantly from country to country. The belief that the needs of people with disabilities outside a country are different or not relevant The Web is worldwide. People with disabilities from other countries, with the same needs for accessibility and using the same kinds of assistive technologies, may need access to the Web-based resources of a particular country. The belief that W3C/WAI guidelines were developed by a single country W3C/WAI guidelines were developed with broad international input, and reflect needs from around the world. The belief that development of local guidelines is the best activity in which to invest local funding for Web accessibility Development of local guidelines takes scarce resources away from activities where building local capacity is crucial – such as development of education, awareness, training and technical assistance on Web accessibility. The belief that it is more practical in the long term to have locally developed guidelines Because Web technologies are constantly evolving, ongoing development and maintenance of local guidelines and techniques into the future may be prohibitively resource-intensive. The belief that Web accessibility can be more easily achieved through locally developed guidelines Web accessibility can be more easily achieved through increased availability of supporting tools and resources, including authoring tools, evaluation tools, browsers, media players, and training and technical resources. These tools and resources develop more rapidly when there is a unified market around a consistent international set of Web accessibility standards. Consequences Web Development For Web developers using today’s authoring tools, development of accessible Web sites first requires an awareness of the need for Web accessibility, then a deliberate effort to apply WCAG. It may require working around features of authoring tools that make it hard to build accessible Web sites. For instance, some authoring tools still produce non-standard markup, which can be a barrier for accessibility. Authoring tools that conform to ATAG provide built-in support for production of accessible Web sites. When Web developers develop accessible Web sites using today’s authoring tools, they may need to work around inconsistent support of Web standards in browsers and media players. For instance, inconsistent initial support in browsers for Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) features, such as CSS positioning, led many Web developers to rely on less accessible design solutions for layout for many years. Browsers and media players that conformed to UAAG would provide reliable support for accessibility features, making the jobs of Web developers much easier. Web developers must already learn a variety of Web technologies and tools in order to be competitive in their field. Harmonization of Web accessibility standards enables Web developers to learn one consistent set of guidelines and implementation techniques, rather than needing to learn many different guidelines; and it allows them to re-use training and technical assistance resources among a broader Web community. Authoring Tools Increased availability of authoring tools conforming to the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) is key to making the Web accessible because, with such tools, Web content developers could more easily and more automatically create accessible Web sites. Authoring tool developers face competing priorities when deciding which features to build into their software. Product managers’ decisions with regard to which features are included in product releases are frequently based on the extent of demand for a given set of features throughout their customer base. Harmonized standards mean a more unified customer demand. This strengthens the business case for accessibility for authoring tool developers and can tip the balance towards implementation of more accessibility features in their products. This, in turn, means more rapid availability of authoring tools with features supporting production of accessible content. Evaluation Tools Developers of evaluation tools are also impacted by fragmented standards, as these can delay, and/or increase the development cost, of the evaluation tools. Time needed to implement evaluation tests for conflicting versions of guidelines could otherwise be used to improve evaluation tools by increasing their usability or accuracy. Harmonized Web accessibility standards would allow developers of accessibility evaluation tools to concentrate their efforts on implementing one set of evaluation tests, rather than multiple tests for overlapping or conflicting guidelines and standards in different regions or economic sectors. Improved evaluation tools enable more people to test Web sites more reliably, and help ensure more accessible Web sites. Organizations When there is fragmentation of standards, organizations that have audiences spanning different geographic regions, countries, or economic sectors must keep track of multiple sets of requirements. Such organizations may need to provide additional authoring tools, evaluation tools, training resources and technical assistance for their Web developers. This can divert resources from the actual development work needed to ensure accessible Web sites. The increase in cost and effort resulting from fragmented standards may consequently make it more difficult to make a convincing business case for accessibility within the organization. Harmonized Web accessibility standards, on the other hand, allow organizations to re-use authoring and evaluation tools, training, and technical assistance resources throughout the organization, thereby achieving more cost-effective accessibility solutions. Browsers, Media Players, and Assistive Technologies The harmonization of Web accessibility standards is also a concern with regard to browsers and media players. Conflicting standards for browser accessibility can slow implementation of accessibility support. Browsers and media players’ lack of conformance to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) makes it harder for people with disabilities to access content on Web sites, and even to find and use the accessibility features that are already incorporated in some browsers and media players. Some of today’s browsers and media players do not provide access to certain kinds of accessibility information that a Web content developer may have included in a Web site; for instance, long descriptions of complex visuals such as maps and graphs, or summaries of information in data tables. UAAG describes how browsers and media players can enable access to such information. UAAG also describes requirements for browsers and media players that can work smoothly with assistive technologies, which some people with disabilities use, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, and voice recognition software. Implementation of accessibility standards in browsers and authoring tools is mutually reinforcing. Once browser developers implement Web accessibility features, authoring tool developers have more reason to provide authoring support for those features. For instance, once browsers provide access to summaries of data tables, authoring tool developers then have a stronger rationale to provide a means for content developers to add summaries to tables. Similarly, browser developers are influenced by what authoring tools support, and are more likely to implement accessibility features once they know that authoring tools will provide the relevant authoring support. Information Repositories Online information repositories allow the gathering and storing of content for re-use in a variety of ways, including the creation of online learning modules. If the content in an information repository conforms to a consistent accessibility standard, then that content can be more easily shared among an unlimited number of users. It can be re-purposed and personalized according to user profiles, which may include information on preferred learning styles and the accessibility requirements of users with disabilities. With harmonized standards for accessibility of content in information repositories, educators and learners are able to freely transform shared resources according to user needs. Action Steps W3C continues to update and refine the WAI guidelines, supporting techniques, and other resources to keep pace with evolving Web technologies. The following steps can increase the international harmonization of Web accessibility standards, and help lead more rapidly to an accessible Web: Participate in development of updated WAI guidelines and support material by reviewing and commenting on drafts, providing feedback during implementation trials, and/or participating in WAI Working Groups. (See Participating in WAI) Promote awareness among policy-makers, standards developers, technology developers, and disability communities of the strategic importance of standards harmonization towards achieving an accessible Web. Ensure that developers of authoring tools, browsers, and media players are aware of the need for ATAG- and UAAG- conformant tools, and aware of how implementation of ATAG and UAAG can improve interoperability with assistive technologies and accelerate overall progress on Web accessibility. For organizations which currently have guidelines that diverge from international standards, consider establishing mechanisms for rapid review and potential transition to the latest version of WCAG. Assist in preparing authorized translations of WAI guidelines according to W3C’s policy for authorized translations. Redirect energies from the development of divergent standards to promoting awareness and providing implementation support for Web accessibility.

Transcript with Visuals Seq. Audio Visual 1 Hi! My name is Shadi Abou-Zahra. I'm the Accessibility Strategy and Technology Specialist at W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, and today I'd like to tell you about web accessibility. Web Accessibility [Shadi speaking] 2 The Web is for many people an essential part of daily life. People in an Internet cafe 3 At work. Someone in an office using a computer 4 At home. Someone sitting in a sofa using a laptop 5 And on the road. Someone using a mobile phone while walking 6 Web accessibility means that people with disabilities can use the Web equally. [Shadi speaking] 7 For example, somebody who cannot use their arms, and uses a mouthstick to type. Someone using a mouthstick to type 8 Or someone who cannot hear well, and uses captions to watch videos. Someone using a hearing aid 9 Or someone who cannot see well, and uses a screen reader to read aloud what's on the screen. Someone using a screen reader 10 Accessibility has many benefits. [Shadi speaking] 11 For example, captions benefit anyone in a loud or in a quite environment. Someone watching a video with captions in an office 12 And good color contrast works better when there is glare. Someone looking at a mobile phone with glare on the screen 13 Also people with age-related impairments, such as reduced dexterity, benefit. Someone with tremors using a mouse with difficulty 14 In fact, everyone has a better user experience with an improved layout and design. Two people smiling happily at a well-designed website 15 A lot of accessibility can be built into the underlying code of websites and applications. [Shadi speaking] 16 Web technologies from W3C, such as HTML, provide many accessibility features. HTML code of a web page 17 For example, to provide textual descriptions for images, which are read aloud by screen readers and also used by search engines. Example code 18 Also headings, labels, and other code supports accessibility and improves the quality overall. Example code 19 Good authoring tools, such as wikis, content management systems, and code editors, help create accessible code - either automatically or with input from the author. Example authoring tool used to create web content 20 Also web browsers, media players, and apps need to support accessibility features. Example web browser used to show web content 21 W3C provides standards to help make the Web accessible, which are internationally recognized by governments and businesses. [Shadi speaking] 22 Most well-known is the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG. WCAG is also ISO 40500, and adopted in the European standard called EN 301 549. It is built around four core principles: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines - WCAG; ISO 40500; EN 301 549 23 First, Perceivable - for example, so people can see the content, or hear it. Someone typing on their tablet computer and listening to it with headphones 24 Operable - for example, so people can use the computer by typing, or by voice. Someone speaking to their computer 25 Understandable - for example, so people get clear and simple language. Two people looking confused at the computer screen with a dense website 26 And Robust - so people can use different assistive technologies. Someone using screen magnification on a large computer screen 27 Besides WCAG, W3C also provides the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG, which defines requirements for code management systems, code editors, and other software. Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines - ATAG 28 And the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG, defines requirements for web browsers and media players. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines - UAAG 29 There are over one billion people with disabilities, or about 15-20% of the population. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities defines that access to information, including the Web, as a human right. Most countries around the world have ratified this UN convention, and several have adopted binding policies too. Yet regardless of any laws and regulations, implementing the accessibility standards is essential for people with disabilities, and useful for all.

    "title": "WCAG-EM Overview: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM). Quick links to the resources: Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator Page Contents Who WCAG-EM is for What is in WCAG-EM WCAG-EM Report Tool Who develops WCAG-EM Introduction Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) is an approach for determining how well a website conforms to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). If you want to get a general sense of how a web page addresses a few accessibility issues, see Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility. It is usually best to do preliminary checks before applying WCAG-EM, and to address potential accessibility barriers before investing in a more thorough review such as WCAG-EM. WCAG-EM is a supporting resource for the WCAG standard; it does not define additional WCAG requirements. It is published as a W3C Working Group Note. Scope WCAG-EM applies to all websites, including web applications and mobile websites. It covers different situations, including self-assessment and third-party evaluation. It is independent of particular evaluation tools, web browsers, or assistive technologies. WCAG-EM is primarily for evaluating conformance of existing websites. However, accessibility should not be left until the evaluation stage; it should be integrated from the beginning and throughout the project lifecycle — in planning, design, and development. Other aspects of evaluation are addressed in related pages of the Evaluating Web Accessibility resource suite. For example, guidance to help you better understand real-world accessibility issues and evaluate effective accessibility solutions is in Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility. Who WCAG-EM is for WCAG-EM is for anyone who wants a common procedure for auditing websites. It is for direct use by internal evaluators, external auditors, benchmarkers, and researchers. Additionally, WCAG-EM can be referred to by managers, procurers, policy makers, regulators, and others. Applying WCAG-EM successfully requires knowledge of WCAG, accessible web design, assistive technologies, and how people with different disabilities use the Web (as described in the WCAG-EM Required Expertise section). What is in WCAG-EM WCAG-EM provides guidance on using the methodology and considerations for specific situations. The conformance evaluation procedure is detailed under 5 main steps: Define the scope of the evaluation - defining what is included in the evaluation; the goal of the evaluation; and the WCAG conformance level (A, AA, AAA). Explore the website - identifying key web pages; key functionality; types of web content, designs, functionality, etc.; required web technologies. Select a representative sample - guidance on structured and randomly selected web pages when it is not feasible to evaluate every web page on a website. Evaluate the selected sample - determining successes and failures in meeting WCAG; accessibility support for website features; and recording evaluation steps. Report the evaluation findings - aggregating and reporting evaluation findings; making evaluation statements; and calculating overall scores. Technical document format WCAG-EM follows the W3C format for technical specifications which includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status with the link to errata and the email address for comments. There is a link at the top to the Table of Contents. WCAG-EM Report Tool The WCAG-EM Report Tool: Website Accessibility Evaluation Report Generator helps you follow the steps of WCAG-EM and generate a structured report from the input that you provide. Who develops WCAG-EM WCAG-EM is developed by the WCAG 2.0 Evaluation Methodology Task Force (Eval TF), which is a joint task force of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group (WCAG WG) and Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group (ERT WG). The Working Groups are part of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI).",

    "title": "Web Content Accessibility and Mobile Web: Making a Website Accessible Both for People with Disabilities and for Mobile Devices",
    "text": "Page Contents Introduction Similar Barriers Similar Solutions Doing Both - Designing for Mobile and for Accessibility Resources Quick links: Shared Web Experiences, Relationship between MWBP and WCAG Related page: Mobile Accessibility Introduction With global mobile phone use at an all time high, there has been a surge of interest in developing websites that are accessible from a mobile device. Similarly, making websites accessible for people with disabilities is an integral part of high quality websites, and in some cases a legal requirement. Most Mobile Web specialists don’t know about design issues for people with disabilities. Likewise, most web accessibility specialists don’t know Mobile Web design best practices. Websites (including applications) can more efficiently meet both goals when designers and developers understand the significant overlap between making a website accessible for a mobile device and for people with disabilities. The similarities are introduced below along with benefits of addressing both and resources with technical details of the overlap. Similar Barriers Users of mobile devices and people with disabilities experience similar barriers when interacting with web content. For example, mobile phone users will have a hard time if a website’s navigation requires the use of a mouse because they typically only have an alphanumeric keypad. Similarly, desktop computer users with a motor disability will have a hard time using a website if they can’t use a mouse. Additionally, people with disabilities sometimes use mobile devices to access websites. Similar Solutions The W3C provides guidelines/standards on making accessible content and best practices for making mobile-friendly content. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a guide for making websites accessible to people with disabilities. Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) is a guide for making websites usable from a mobile device. Mobile Web Application Best Practices (MWABP) is a guide for developing and delivering web applications on mobile devices. There is an overlap between MWBP, MWABP and WCAG. For example, the MWBP best practice on tab order (“Create a logical order through links, form controls and objects”) corresponds with the WCAG 2.0 success criteria on focus order (“…focusable components receive focus in an order that preserves meaning and operability”). Doing Both - Designing for Mobile and for Accessibility Following these two guidelines makes your web content more accessible to everyone regardless of situation, environment, or device. Designing to the guidelines together, instead of separately, can make the process more efficient — especially when considered early in the project. Websites that already meet WCAG or MWBP are already well on the way to meeting the other. Understanding the overlap also strengthens the business case for adopting WCAG or MWBP in a website that already complies with one, or for adopting both together. See also Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization. Resources The following resources provide a detailed mapping of the overlap between the barriers and solutions for making websites accessible to people with disabilities and usable on mobile devices. Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities lists web interaction that is similar by a user with a disability and by a user with a mobile device. It links to recommendations for designing web content without these barriers from WCAG, MWBP, and MWABP. Relationship between Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) includes the following pages: From MWBP to WCAG 2.0 and From MWBP to WCAG 1.0 are designed for those who already know MWBP and want to learn how they relate to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). From WCAG 2.0 to MWBP and From WCAG 1.0 to MWBP are designed for those who already know WCAG and want to learn how it relates to the Mobile Web Best Practices (MWBP).",

    "text": "Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. Learn about the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations. Video on Video Captions Enable Audio Description What is “Video Captions”? Captions are a text form of audio information in video and animations. This includes the words that are spoken, who is speaking when it is not evident, and important sounds like music, laughter, and noises. Captions must be synchronized with the visual content to contextualize them. Who depends on this feature? People who are deaf and cannot hear the audio. People who are hard of hearing and cannot hear some of the content. People with cognitive and learning disabilities who need to see and hear the content to better understand it. What are the additional benefits? Content can be used in loud environments where you cannot hear the audio. Content can be used in silent environments where you cannot turn on sound. Content can be better understood by people hearing and seeing the information, for example people who are less fluent in the language spoken. Content can be read rather than watched, which is easier and quick for some people for some types of videos. Content in text form, such as caption files and transcripts, can be better indexed by search engines. Content can be used without needing to download video files, for example to save data on mobile. What needs to happen for this to work? Captions must be made available with pre-recorded and live video content. Voice recognition software can help create captions for some type of videos. Sometimes such voice recognition software is built into the computer or social media platform. Automatically-generated captions often need editing. For many languages there are captioning services, often also remote services.

    "text": "Web accessibility is essential for people with disabilities and useful for all. Learn about the impact of accessibility and the benefits for everyone in a variety of situations. Video on Colors with Good Contrast Enable Audio Description What is “Colors with Good Contrast”? Colors must have sufficient contrast between text color and its background (technically called luminosity contrast ratio). This includes text on images, icons, and buttons. Also colors used to convey information on diagrams, maps, and other types of images must be distinguishable. Who depends on this feature? People with low contrast sensitivity, which is common in older people. People with color blindness who cannot distinguish between certain colors. What are the additional benefits? Content works in different lighting conditions, such as sunlight and glare. Content is easier to read by everyone, including those who do not have specific visual conditions. What needs to happen for this to work? Select text and background colors that provide sufficient contrast. There are tools to help check and select appropriate color combinations. This is ideally done during the early design stage and the selection of color palettes. While some people need high contrast, some people are sensitive to brightness and need to change the colors.

Video on Large Links, Buttons, and Controls Enable Audio Description What is “Large Links, Buttons, and Controls”? The area for clicking and tapping controls must be large enough for people to activate them. This includes links, buttons, checkboxes, and other controls. Small controls, and controls that are placed too close to each other, are difficult for many people to use. This is particularly relevant on mobile devices with small screens. Who depends on this feature? People with physical disabilities who have reduced dexterity. What are the additional benefits? Content is more usable on touch screens, especially on smaller mobile devices. Content is more usable for people who are not experienced with the mouse or touch-pad on the computer they are using. Content is more usable in situations where the device cannot be held steady. What needs to happen for this to work? Design large controls or activation areas around the controls. (Increasing the font size of the control sometimes isn’t enough.) Provide adequate separation between selectable controls. Provide labels for controls, which enlarges the activation area in many browsers because the label for checkboxes and option buttons is also clickable.

Video on Customizable Text Enable Audio Description What is “Customizable Text”? Some users need to be able to change the way text is displayed so that they can read the text. This includes changing the size, spacing, font, color, and other text properties. When users change these properties, no information or functionality should be lost, and the text should re-flow so users don’t have to scroll horizontally to read sentences. Text customization is more than the zoom functionality, which only changes the text size. Who depends on this feature? People with low vision who are not using screen magnification software. People with some forms of dyslexia and other cognitive and learning disabilities who need a particular presentation of text to read it. What are the additional benefits? Content is more adaptable to smaller and larger screen sizes. Content is more adaptable to personal preferences and comfort. Content is more adaptable when translated, since words and sentences are different lengths in different languages. What needs to happen for this to work? Content must be properly designed and coded so that it can adapt to different customization settings. This includes using relative rather than absolute units for the size of fonts, controls, and other objects. Applications should use the operating system and web browser text settings. Websites and applications could also provide information to help users change their settings. Web browsers and other web tools need to provide users with text customization functionality.

    "title": "Diverse Abilities and Barriers",
    "text": "Summary This page explores the wide diversity of people and abilities. It highlights some web accessibility barriers that people commonly experience because of inaccessible websites and web tools. Note: This page is illustrative and is not a complete list of all disabilities and barriers. Page Contents Diversity of abilities Auditory Cognitive, learning, and neurological Physical Speech Visual Diversity of abilities There are many reasons why people may be experiencing varying degrees of auditory, cognitive, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. For instance, some may have disabilities from birth, an illness, disease, or accident, or they may develop impairments with age. Some may not consider themselves to have disabilities even if they do experience such functional limitations. More about diversity of abilities Each individual is unique. People have diverse abilities, skills, tools, preferences, and expectations that can impact how they use the Web. For instance, consider the following aspects: Age-related impairments: Many people develop age-related impairments. While they share the same functional requirements as others with disabilities, sometimes there are significant differences in the use of assistive technologies, the level of computer skills, or in the use of the Web in general. Multiple disabilities: Some people have combinations of different kinds of disabilities, which may limit their approaches for interacting with the Web. For example, someone who is deaf and has low vision might benefit from captions for audio, but only if these captions have adjustable size and color. Health conditions: Some people have health conditions that may affect their stamina, dexterity, or concentration. For instance, some may experience fatigue, pain, or other symptoms that could have an impact on their physical use of the computer or limit the duration or extent of their use of the Web. Changing abilities: Some people may be experiencing progressive or recurring functional limitations that impact their use of the Web differently at different times. For example, some may need particular accessibility features on one day, and others or none on another day, depending on their condition. Temporary impairments: Some people may be experiencing temporary impairments such as those that may occur due to an accident, surgery, or medication. They may not know about accessibility solutions, may not know how to use accessibility features, and may be unaware of their needs. Situational limitations: Some people may be experiencing constraints due to their surrounding or due to other situational aspects. For example, they may be in a loud environment and unable to hear audio, in bright sunlight and unable to see a screen, or they may not be able to afford some technologies. Websites and web tools designed for people with a broad range of abilities benefit everyone, including people without disabilities. It is, therefore, important to consider the broad diversity of functional needs rather than to categorize people according to medical classifications. Auditory Auditory disabilities range from mild or moderate hearing loss in one or both ears (“hard of hearing”) to substantial and uncorrectable hearing loss in both ears (“deafness”). Some people with auditory disabilities can hear sounds but sometimes not sufficiently to understand all speech, especially when there is background noise. This can include people using hearing aids. More about auditory disabilities While multimedia on the Web provides many opportunities for people with auditory disabilities, it also poses challenges when content is not designed to be accessible. For example, while video content can be used to communicate information visually, audio content needs to have alternatives, such as transcripts and captions, so that it is accessible for people with auditory disabilities. To use the Web effectively, people with auditory disabilities often rely on: Transcripts and captions of audio content, including audio-only content and audio tracks in multimedia; Media players that display captions and provide options to adjust the text size and colors of captions; Options to stop, pause, and adjust the volume of audio content (independently of the system volume); High-quality foreground audio that is clearly distinguishable from any background noise. For some people with auditory disabilities, sign language is the primary language, and they may not read the written language as fluently. Providing important information in sign language and using simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations help make web content more understandable to many people. However, it is important to remember that not all people with auditory disabilities know sign language. Examples of auditory disabilities Hard of hearing – mild or moderate hearing impairments in one or both ears. Deafness – substantial, uncorrectable impairment of hearing in both ears. Deaf-blindness – substantial, uncorrectable hearing and visual impairments. Examples of barriers for people with auditory disabilities Audio content, such as videos with voices and sounds, without captions or transcripts. Media players that do not display captions and that do not provide volume controls. Media players that do not provide options to adjust the text size and colors for captions. Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only. Lack of sign language to supplement important information and text that is difficult to read. Stories related to auditory disabilities Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Cognitive, learning, and neurological Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders, as well as behavioral and mental health disorders that are not necessarily neurological. They may affect any part of the nervous system and impact how well people hear, move, see, speak, and understand information. Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities do not necessarily affect the intelligence of a person. More about cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Computer technologies and the Web provide many opportunities for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities to interact with content and to process information in ways that are more usable to them. For example, people can navigate web content using different strategies, access information in text, audio, or other formats, and change the presentation of the content according to their individual needs or preferences. Depending on the individual needs, people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities often rely on: Clearly structured content that facilitates overview and orientation; Consistent labeling of forms, buttons, and other content parts; Predictable link targets, functionality, and overall interaction; Different ways of navigating websites, such as hierarchical menu and search; Options to suppress blinking, flickering, flashing, and otherwise distracting content; Simpler text that is supplemented by images, graphs, and other illustrations; People with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities use different types of web browsing methods, depending on their particular needs. For example, some people use text-to-speech software to hear the information while reading it visually or use captions to read the information while hearing it. Some people use tools that resize text and spacing or customize colors to assist reading. Others use grammar and spelling tools to support writing. For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to consider web accessibility requirements which are often shared by people with hearing, physical, speech, and visual disabilities. Examples of cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (formerly “attention deficit disorder (ADD)”) – involves difficulty focusing on a single task, focusing for longer periods, or being easily distracted. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (includes “autism,” “Asperger syndrome,” and “pervasive developmental disorder” (PDD)) - involves impairments of social communication and interaction abilities, and sometimes restricted habits and interests. Intellectual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Europe and some other countries, and “developmental disabilities” in other regions) – involves impairments of intelligence, learning more slowly, or difficulty understanding complex concepts. Down syndrome is one among many different causes of intellectual disabilities. Learning disabilities – is a functional term rather than a medical condition, and is not uniformly defined. In Europe and some other countries, it refers to intellectual disabilities, while in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries it refers to perceptual disabilities. Mental health disabilities – includes anxiety, delirium, depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, and many other disorders. These conditions may cause difficulty focusing on information, processing information, or understanding it. In particular medication for these disorders may have side effects including blurred vision, hand tremors, and other impairments. Memory impairments – involves limited short-term memory, missing long-term memory, or limited ability to recall language. Dementia is one among many different causes of memory impairments. Multiple sclerosis – causes damage to nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and can affect auditory, cognitive, physical, or visual abilities, in particular during relapses. Neurodiversity – is a societal rather than medical term to describe the natural diversity in neurocognitive functioning, alike gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and disability. Perceptual disabilities (sometimes called “learning disabilities” in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and some other countries) – involves difficulty processing auditory, tactile, visual, or other sensory information. This can impact reading (dyslexia), writing (dysgraphia), processing numbers (dyscalculia), or spatial and temporal orientation. Seizure disorders – includes different types of epilepsy and migraines, which may be in reaction to visual flickering or audio signals at certain frequencies or patterns. Examples of barriers for people with cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Complex navigation mechanisms and page layouts that are difficult to understand and use. Complex sentences that are difficult to read and unusual words that are difficult to understand. Long passages of text without images, graphs, or other illustrations to highlight the context. Moving, blinking, or flickering content, and background audio that cannot be turned off. Web browsers and media players that do not provide mechanisms to suppress animations and audio. Visual page designs that cannot be adapted using web browser controls or custom style sheets. Stories related to cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Physical Physical disabilities (sometimes called “motor disabilities”) include weakness and limitations of muscular control (such as involuntary movements including tremors, lack of coordination, or paralysis), limitations of sensation, joint disorders (such as arthritis), pain that impedes movement, and missing limbs. More about physical disabilities To use the Web, people with physical disabilities often use specialized hardware and software such as: Ergonomic or specially designed keyboard or mouse; Head pointer, mouth stick, and other aids to help with typing; On-screen keyboard with trackball, joysticks, or other pointing devices; Switches operated by foot, shoulder, sip-and-puff, or other movements; Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction. People with physical disabilities may be using a mouse or mouse-like device only, or keyboard or keyboard-like device only to operate the computer. People with physical disabilities rely on keyboard support to activate functionality provided on web pages. They may need more time to type, click, or carry out other interaction, and they may type single keystrokes in sequence rather than typing simultaneous keystrokes (“chording”) to activate commands. Such keystrokes include commands for special characters, shortcut keys, and to active menu items. People with physical disabilities may have trouble clicking small areas and are more likely to make mistakes in typing and clicking. Providing large clickable areas, enough time to complete tasks, and error correction options for forms are important design aspects. Other important design aspects include providing visible indicators of the current focus, and mechanisms to skip over blocks, such as over page headers or navigation bars. People with cognitive and visual disabilities share many of these requirements. Examples of physical disabilities Amputation – includes missing fingers, limbs, or other parts of the human body. Arthritis (previously called “rheumatism”) – inflammation, degeneration, or damage to the joints. Fibromyalgia (formerly called “rheumatism”) – the chronic pain of muscle and connective tissues. Rheumatism – typically refers to arthritis and other causes of bone or joint pain, and sometimes to fibromyalgia and other causes for muscular and other soft tissue pain. Reduced dexterity – is a functional term (rather than a medical condition) that describes the ability to control the hand, such as hand-eye coordination of people with cognitive and neurological disabilities. Muscular dystrophy – progressive weakness and degeneration of muscles, sometimes including in arms and hands. Repetitive stress injury (RSI) (also called “repetitive motion disorder” (RMD) and “cumulative trauma disorder” (CT)) - involves injuries to the musculoskeletal system (bones, joints, tendons, and other connective tissues) and the nervous system from repetitive tasks and damage. Tremor and spasms – involuntary movement or muscle contraction, including short twitches, and continual or rhythmic muscle contractions. Quadriplegia (sometimes called “tetraplegia”) - partial or total paralysis (includes motor control and sensation) to all four body limbs (legs and arms) and the torso. Examples of barriers for people with physical disabilities Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support. Insufficient time limits to respond or to complete tasks, such as to fill out online forms. Controls, including links with images of text, that do not have equivalent text alternatives. Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids. Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions. Stories related to physical disabilities Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Speech Speech disabilities include difficulty producing speech that is recognizable by others or by voice recognition software. For example, the loudness or clarity of someone’s voice might be difficult to understand. More about speech disabilities People with speech disabilities encounter barriers with voice-based services, such as automated web-based hotlines and web applications that are operated using voice commands. To use services that rely on voice, people with speech disabilities need alternative modes of interaction such as a text-based chat to interact with hotline representatives and keyboard commands to operate web applications. Also, websites that provide telephone numbers as the only means of communicating with an organization pose barriers for people with speech disabilities. Alternative means of communication include e-mail and feedback forms. Examples of speech disabilities Apraxia of speech (AOS) – includes inconsistent articulation and production of speech sounds, and errors producing sounds in the correct order so that spoken words or phrases become difficult to understand. Cluttering (also called “tachyphemia”) – includes increased speaking rate, incorrect rhythm, intonation, and co-articulation of sounds, and other influent speech that is sometimes similar to stuttering. Dysarthria – involves weakness or complete paralysis of muscles that are necessary to produce speech, including lips, lungs, throat, tongue, and others. Speech sound disorder – involves difficulty or inability to produce certain sounds or patterns of sound and sometimes results in addition, distortion, omission, or substitution of such sounds with others. Stuttering – includes influent speech, repetition of individual sounds or entire words and phrases, and misplacement or prolongation of pauses and sounds while speaking that is different from cluttering. Muteness (also called “mutism”) – involves the inability to speak due to various reasons such as anxiety, brain injuries, or inability to hear and learn speech. Examples of barriers for people with speech disabilities Web-based services, including web applications, that rely on interaction using voice only. Websites that offer phone numbers as the only way to communicate with the organizations. Visual Visual disabilities range from mild or moderate vision loss in one or both eyes (“low vision”) to substantial and uncorrectable vision loss in both eyes (“blindness”). Some people have reduced or lack of sensitivity to certain colors (“color blindness”), or increased sensitivity to bright colors. These variations in perception of colors and brightness can be independent of the visual acuity. More about visual disabilities People with visual disabilities typically rely on changing the presentation of web content into forms that are more usable for their particular needs. For example by: Enlarging or reducing text size and images; Customizing settings for fonts, colors, and spacing; Listening to text-to-speech synthesis of the content; Listening to audio descriptions of video in multimedia; Reading text using refreshable Braille. For these web browsing methods to work, developers need to ensure that the presentation of web content is independent of its underlying structure and that the structure is correctly coded so that it can be processed and presented in different ways by web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, some people do not see the content and rely on lists, headings, tables, and other page structures to be properly coded so that they can be identified by web browsers and assistive technologies. Some people are only seeing small portions of the content at a time or are perceiving the colors and design differently. Some people are using customized fonts, colors, and spacing to make the content more readable, or they are navigating through the content using keyboard only because they cannot see the mouse pointer. An accessible design supports different presentations of the web content and different ways of interaction. Examples of visual disabilities Color blindness – includes difficulty distinguishing between colors such as between red and green, or between yellow and blue, and sometimes inability to perceive any color. Low vision – (in some regions also called “partial sight”) includes poor acuity (vision that is not sharp), tunnel vision (seeing only the middle of the visual field), central field loss (seeing only the edges of the visual field), and clouded vision. Blindness – substantial, uncorrectable loss of vision in both eyes. Deaf-blindness – substantial, uncorrectable visual and hearing impairments. Examples of barriers for people with visual disabilities Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives. Text, images, and page layouts that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized. Missing visual and non-visual orientation cues, page structure, and other navigational aids. Video content that does not have text or audio alternatives, or an audio-description track. Inconsistent, unpredictable, and overly complicated navigation mechanisms and page functions. Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations. Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not support the use of custom color combinations. Websites, web browsers, and authoring tools that do not provide full keyboard support.

    "title": "Tools and Techniques",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces some of the techniques and tools that people with disabilities use to interact with the web — web browser settings, text-to-speech, voice recognition, and many more. Note: This page is illustrative and is not a complete list of all the ways that people interact with the web. Page Contents Tools and preferences Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing Presentation - distinguishing and understanding Input - typing, writing, and clicking Interaction - navigating and finding Tools and preferences People with disabilities access and navigate the Web in different ways, depending on their individual needs and preferences. Sometimes people configure standard software and hardware according to their needs, and sometimes people use specialized software and hardware that help them perform certain tasks. More about tools and preferences Some common approaches for interacting with the Web include: Assistive Technologies – software and hardware that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the web. These include screen readers that read aloud web pages for people who cannot read the text, screen magnifiers for people with some types of low vision, and voice recognition software and selection switches for people who cannot use a keyboard or mouse. Adaptive Strategies – techniques that people with disabilities use to improve interaction with the Web, such as increasing text size, reducing mouse speed, and turning on captions. Adaptive strategies include techniques with standard software, with mainstream web browsers, and with assistive technologies. Accessibility benefits people with and without disabilities. Features that support accessibility are becoming increasingly available in standard computer hardware, mobile devices, operating systems, web browsers, and other tools. Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer provides information about customizing your computer to take advantage of such accessibility features and solutions. Sometimes hardware and software with specific accessibility features, including web browsers, media players, or assistive technologies, may not be available to an individual. For example, tools may not be affordable, not installed or not compatible with the computer, not available in some languages, or not available for other reasons. In other cases, people are unaware of accessibility solutions or how to configure and use them. Perception - hearing, feeling, and seeing People perceive content through different senses depending on their needs and preferences. For example, some people are not seeing the screen or hearing the audio. Examples of perception include: Auditory - such as speech, music, and sound that can be heard. Tactile - such as dots, bars, and vibration that can be felt. Visual - such as images, text, and video that can be seen. More about perception Some people need to convert content from one form to another to perceive it. For example, someone who is deaf-blind requires audio and visual content in a tactile form (such as Braille). Other people need to perceive content through multiple senses, such as someone with dyslexia who may need to hear and see the text to understand it better. Content in textual form can be more easily converted into other forms and is therefore particularly useful. However, text-only content poses barriers for many people who have difficulty with written language. Graphics and illustrations can be made accessible and often improve understandability, ease-of-use, and satisfaction with websites and applications for everyone. In some cases, content can be converted into different forms using software or hardware. For example, a text-to-speech software can convert text into speech. In other cases, content authors need to provide alternative forms of the content. For example, at least some level of human intervention is necessary to create textual descriptions for images and captions for audio content. Sometimes software tools, such as voice and picture recognition, can assist authors in providing such alternatives but the conversion is usually not fully automatable. Examples of accessibility features Audio descriptions – (also referred to as “video descriptions” and “described video”) narrations that describe important visual details in a video. These narrations can be during natural pauses in the audio, or in separate audio files or audio tracks in multimedia. Auditory, tactile, and visual notifications - prompting or alerting the user in different ways such as by blinking or displaying visual dialogs, by using sound, or by vibration. Braille – a system using six to eight raised dots in various patterns, to represent letters and numbers. These characters are read by scanning over the raised dots using the fingertips. Braille is used by people who are blind but not all individuals who are blind know braille. Captions – text with a verbatim recording of any speech and with descriptions of relevant auditory information that appears simultaneously with the audio (including audio that accompanies video in multimedia). For real-time captioning typically professional CART writers are necessary. Text-to-speech (sometimes called “speech synthesis” or “speech output”) - automatic conversion of text into a synthesized voice reading the text aloud. Transcripts – text manuscripts containing the correct sequence of verbatim recording of any speech, and descriptions of important auditory or visual information. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Refreshable Braille display – a mechanical terminal that displays a line of Braille characters (usually 40-80) by raising and lowering the dots (pins) dynamically. Braille devices with capabilities of small computers incorporate Braille displays. These devices can be used to take notes, calculate numbers, or to interface with other devices such as public information kiosks. Screen reader – software that processes content on the desktop and in web browsers, and converts it to others forms such as text-to-speech and Braille. Screen readers typically provide other functions such as shortcut keys, different modes for processing content and interacting with it, and the ability to highlight the text that is being read aloud. Voice browser – similar to screen reader but usually only processes web content. Voice browsers are typically not developed as assistive tools but as alternative web browsers for mobile devices or similar. Stories related to perception Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Presentation - distinguishing and understanding People adjust the presentation of content to make it easier to distinguish and understand. These adjustments include: Making audio content easier to hear and visual content easier to see; Combining audio and visual content to make information easier to understand; Providing alternative presentations of the content, such as sign-language. More about presentation Some people need larger text and image sizes or higher contrast between text and background colors to see the content better, and some people need louder audio with lower background noise to better hear the content. Some people need to turn off pop-up windows and animations that disorient or distract them. A sound that is automatically played, such as background music on a website, can also distract people or interfere with text-to-speech software. Web content, browsers, and tools need to support adjusting the presentation according to peoples’ needs and preferences. Making text more readable is of particular importance. This involves changing its visual appearance, using additional text-to-speech, and adapting the content. For example, changing the font type, colors, spacing, and line width makes texts more readable for many people. Sometimes text-to-speech is used to assist reading further. Adapting the content involves rearranging sections of web pages, adding functionality such as dictionaries and glossaries, and hiding less used functionality. While these changes are often managed using specialized web browsers and tools, website authors need to provide adequate coding to support such adjustments and adaptations. Also, people process information differently. This aspect is particularly relevant for learning environments but also applies to many other situations. In some cases, authors can provide different representations of the same information to address the widest audience possible, such as graphical and tabular representations of data for people with different learning styles, or sign language videos for sign language users. Examples of accessibility features Customized fonts and colors – changing the font types, sizes, colors, and spacing to make text easier to read. Customization involves browser settings and, for more advanced users, cascading style sheets (CSS) to override the default appearance of web content. Document outline – representation of the content that only shows the headings and relevant structures (such as headings nesting and hierarchy) to help provide orientation and an overview of the contents. Easy-to-read text – simplified summaries for passages of text to help make it easier to understand. Progressive disclosure – design technique that involves showing only the least amount of information or functions necessary for a given task or purpose, to avoid overloading the user with information. Reduced interface – representation of the content that only shows most relevant information or more frequently used functions; for example, by hiding other parts of the content that can distract users. Screen magnification – changing the settings of the web browser, operating system, or screen to enlarge or reduce text size and images. Some people use magnification lenses, binoculars, or other visual aids, and software such as screen magnifiers to better see the content. Sign language – a visual form of communication that is primarily used by people who are deaf. It involves hand, body, and facial expressions to transmit words, phrase, and tone. For instance, the intensity of a gesture could indicate the mood or emphasis of particular information. As in written languages, there are many sign languages and dialects, some of which are recognized as official languages in some countries. Not all people who have auditory disabilities or who are deaf know sign language. Symbols – icons that represent words or concepts used instead of text by some people with impaired communication, including people with difficulties to read or write. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Pop-up and animations blockers – web browser plug-ins or other software tools that stop automatic pop-up windows and redirection, and options to stop, pause, and hide animations. Reading assistants – software that changes the presentation of content and provides other functionality to make it more readable. Examples include: Customizing the font type, size, spacing, or foreground and background colors; Scanning the text for complex words and phrases, and linking them to glossaries; Hiding less relevant parts of the content, such as sidebars and header areas; Providing outlines of the page headings and summaries of the text passages; Reading the content aloud and highlight the text as it is being read out loud. Screen magnifier – software used primarily by people with partial sight to enlarge the content to make it easier to see. Some screen magnifiers provide text-to-speech and other functionality. Volume control – options to adjust the volume of audio content being played, including options to turn off the sound altogether, that are separate from the overall system settings. Stories related to presentation Lee, online shopper with color blindness Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Input - typing, writing, and clicking People use different approaches to enter text and activate commands. For instance, some people do not use a mouse, keyboard, or both, while others use specific configurations for keyboard and mouse, or use alternative hardware and software altogether. Examples of input include using: Keyboard only by people with cognitive, physical, and visual disabilities; Touch screen only by people with cognitive and physical disabilities; Mouse and keyboard with software that compensates for hand tremor; Voice recognition (speech input) and other hands-free interaction. More about input Some people use software and customized settings to enhance the efficiency of typing, writing, and clicking. For example, some people assign personalized shortcut keys to functions they frequently use. Some people use word prediction software to help complete words and sentences with minimal typing, grammar and spelling tools to help correct text, and tools to help click, select text, and scroll with minimal movement. Web content needs to be designed to support these different types of approaches. For example, forms, links, and other functionality need to be usable by keyboard. In particular, web applications (“client-side scripting”), embedded media players, and other programmatic objects need to provide full keyboard support that does not trap the keyboard focus within the program and larger clickable areas for buttons and links. Accessible web content supports people who need more time typing, writing, and clicking, or are more likely to make mistakes. For instance, some people forget to select options and fill out form entries, misspell words and mistype data (such as dates), or unintentionally activate buttons and links. Accessible web content also provides enough time to complete tasks, clear and helpful error messages and options for correcting input. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Accelerators – software and functionality that help reduce the effort needed to type or click. For example, by providing options to create shortcuts for commands or sequences of commands, by highlighting selection choices such as menu items, links, or options, and by helping to steer the mouse. Alternative keyboard and mouse – hardware and software primarily used by people with cognitive and physical disabilities to help interact with the computer. Examples include: Keyboards with larger keys, key labels, key spacing, illuminated keys, or custom layouts; On-screen keyboards, touch-screens, sip-and-puff switches, and single-key switches; Trackballs, joysticks, touchpads, specially designed mice, and other pointing devices; Voice recognition, eye tracking, and other approaches for hands-free interaction. Eye tracking (sometimes called “eye-gaze”) - a system that monitors eye movement to control the mouse pointer and detects blinking to initiate mouse clicks. Keyboard customization – includes changing the mapping of keys, assigning shortcut keys to functions, setting filters, and setting “sticky keys” to support single-handed typing. Keyboard and mouse filters – functions of the operating system or software tools that recognize and compensate for involuntary movements such as tremor and spasms. Mouse customization – includes changing the mapping of buttons, changing the sensitivity of the mouse towards movement, setting filters, and changing the size and appearance of the mouse pointer. On-screen keyboard – virtual keyboard displayed on a screen so that it can be used with a touchscreen, mouse, trackball, joystick, or other pointing devices. Spelling and grammar tools – web browser functions, plug-ins, or other software tools to help users write. Voice recognition (sometimes called “speech input” or “voice command”) - software that recognizes the human voice and can be used to dictate text or to issue commands to operate the computer. Word prediction – software that presents selections of matching words, phrases, or sentences based on the current input (and sometimes context) to save typing. Stories related to input Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Preety, middle school student with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Interaction - navigating and finding People navigate and find content using different strategies and approaches depending on their preferences, skills, and abilities. For instance, someone using a website for the first time may need clearer guidance than someone who has more experience with the particular site, and someone using the Web on a mobile device with a small screen may require more orientational cues than someone using a desktop computer. While these are typically usability aspects that affect people with and without disabilities, some situations affect people with disabilities to a greater extent. More about interaction Examples of such situations include: A person is not seeing the screen and needing to get an overview and orient themselves by scanning the headings on a web page; the headings need to be also designed to support such purposes. A person who is only seeing small portions of the screen at a time due to screen magnification, and need to orient themselves using visual cues; the visual design needs to also support such purposes. A person using only the keyboard (or keyboard alternatives) to navigate through the web content; the structure of web pages need to be designed to also support and efficient use of the keyboard. A person who has difficulty remembering the addresses, names, or particular functionality of websites; web browsers need to provide supporting functionality that is easy to use and remember. A person who may have difficulty with hierarchical menu navigation, as how most navigation menus are designed to be; websites need to provide alternative mechanisms for navigation. Many functions to support different styles of navigation are built directly into web browsers and assistive technologies. For example, most commonly available browsers provide bookmark functionality, and screen readers provide functions to list headings, links, and other structures on a web page. However, the design of the content is also an essential factor to support different styles of navigation. Examples of accessibility features Consistency and predictability – labeling of functions such as links, buttons, and controls should be consistent, and the expected function should be predictable from the label. Descriptive titles, headings, and labels – page titles, section headings, and labels for forms, links, and controls are sometimes read on their own or out of context and need to be descriptive. Helpful error and success messages – dialogs and other messages, such as after submitting forms, need to help users complete their tasks and avoid disorientation, distraction, confusion, or discomfort. Multiple navigation mechanisms – websites need to provide multiple ways to locate web pages, for example by providing sitemaps and search functionality in addition to hierarchical navigation menus. Skip links – mechanisms to allow keyboard users to skip over repetitive blocks of content such as page headings, navigation bars, or menus. Note: too many skip links are counterproductive to this purpose. Visual orientation cues – examples include using background colors to indicate different parts of the content, using unique headings, and placing relevant information in prominent areas of a web page. Examples of assistive technologies and adaptive strategies Bookmarks and history – using web browser functions to help remember pages, find previously visited pages, or quickly go to pages without needing to type a web address. Keyword search – using web browser functions to find text within a web page, and website functionality to search for web pages by keyword. Search engines that are maintained and optimized for a particular website can provide more precise search results. Keyboard navigation – moving through the content using the keyboard, typically by using the tab key to jump from one structural item such as link, header, or list item, to the next. Keyboard navigation largely depends on web browser support but also on website design features such as skip links. Page maps – displaying a small image of the entire web page with an indicator highlighting the portion within the web page that is being currently viewed. Pictorial links – some web browsers, plug-ins, and websites show small images of the link targets (sometimes called “screen shots”) rather than the addresses or names; for example in combination with bookmarks and history listings, back and forward buttons in web browsers, or links on web pages.

    "text": "Summary The following stories of people with disabilities using the Web highlight the effect of accessibility barriers and the broader benefits of accessible websites and web tools. Note: The following scenarios are not real people. They do not address every kind of disability. Page Contents Lee, online shopper with color blindness Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Martine, online student who is hard of hearing Ilya, senior staff member who is blind Preety, middle school student with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and dyslexia Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Luis, supermarket assistant with Down syndrome Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Lee, online shopper with color blindness Lee is colorblind and encounters barriers when shopping online. He has one of the most common visual disabilities that affect men: red and green color blindness. Lee frequently shops online and sometimes encounters problems on websites and with apps where the color contrast of text and images is not adequate and where color alone is used to indicate required fields and sale prices. When red and green color combinations are used, Lee cannot distinguish between the two, since both look brown to him. It is also very difficult for him to make product choices when color swatches are not labeled with the name of the color. Lee has better experiences with online content and apps that use adequate contrast and allow him to adjust contrast settings in his browser. He is also better able to recognize when information is required when asterisks are used. Lee can more easily identify the products he would like to purchase, especially clothing, when the color label names are included in the selection options rather than color swatches alone. For more information on implementing techniques that remove barriers for Lee, see the following resources: Sections related to Lee Diverse Abilities and Barriers Color blindness (Visual disabilities) Tools and Techniques Customized fonts and colors (Presentation) Accessibility principles: Content can be presented in different ways (Perceivable) Content is easier to see and hear (Perceivable) Content is compatible with current and future user tools (Robust) Alex, reporter with repetitive stress injury Alex has worked as a reporter for more than 20 years and has developed a repetitive strain injury that makes it painful to use a mouse and to type for extended periods of time. Though it took considerable research, time, and commitment to learn, he is able to work with less pain using the following modifications to his work environment: use of an ergonomic keyboard use of keyboard commands without a mouse voice recognition software on his computer and mobile phone assistive touch on his mobile phone Alex encounters problems when websites and other online content cannot be navigated by keyboard commands alone. He frequently encounters web forms that do not have keyboard equivalents. Sometimes it is also difficult to skip content and navigate to sections on a webpage without using many keyboard commands, which is very tiring and limits the time he can spend working comfortably. He also recently began to explore the use of assistive touch on his mobile phone which also helps him use fewer gestures and work for longer periods of time. As a temporary fix, Alex’s employer has built several custom work arounds that provide keyboard support for his use of the company’s internal Content Management System with the intention to implement improved keyboard support to benefit all users on the next release of the software.

She can hear some sounds, but not enough to understand speech. As a child she learned sign language and during her early school years learned written language. She is currently a student again, taking online college courses. The university she attends provides sign language interpreters and Communication Access Realtime Translation (CART) writers who provide written verbatim text interpreting of spoken language for her courses. However, Martine has encountered barriers when video and other media content are not captioned. The university became aware of the need and requirement to provide captioned media and transcripts for audio content and is now working with a captioning provider to caption all content posted on university websites, including all course content in learning management systems. In addition to providing access to the content for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, the university has found that the use of captions and transcripts has added benefits. Transcripts facilitate easier production of subtitles in a number of languages and also improve the indexing of online content. Improved indexing provides improved search engine optimization and improved discoverability of the university’s online content. The university follows WCAG guidelines in providing the captioned content.

She is the chief accountant at an insurance company that uses web-based documents and forms over a corporate intranet and like many other blind computer users, she does not read Braille. Ilya uses a screen reader and mobile phone to access the web. Both her screen reader and her mobile phone accessibility features provide her with information regarding the device’s operating system, applications, and text content in a speech output form. When accessing web content, the screen reader indicates aloud the structural information on a webpage such as headings, column and row headers in tables, list items, links, form controls, and more that enable her to better navigate the page, complete and submit forms, and access information in an effective manner. She is able to listen to and understand speech output at a very high speed. Ilya encounters problems when websites are not properly coded and do not include alt text descriptions on images. These sites are unnavigable and require large amounts of time to read text from the top of the page to the bottom without navigation cues. Occasionally she finds herself trapped in areas on a webpage unable to move to another area and must abandon the page altogether. As a senior member of her organization, Ilya provides training to employees in online environments through the use of video conferencing applications, document and slide sharing applications as well as chat rooms. Ilya and her staff evaluated a number of training tools before finding an effective application with accessibility features that meet the needs of a diverse staff with diverse abilities.

Although she has substantial difficulty reading, she particularly enjoys her literature class. Preety’s school recently started using online digital textbooks. Preety was initially worried about using this new format, but with the use of text-to-speech software that highlights the text on the screen as it reads it aloud, she has found that she can focus on the content more easily instead of struggling over every word. The text-to-speech software is also helpful with other online text; however, Preety’s experience with websites varies greatly from one site to another. Some sites use graphics and illustrations in a way that helps her to focus on the sections and content that she would like to read, while other sites have a lot of advertisements and moving content that is very distracting. She also experiences problems with online content when the navigation is not clearly evident. She finds websites and apps that provide multiple means of navigation such as a navigation bar, search box, bread-crumb trails, and a sitemap to be much easier to use. Preety’s school is also using a new online library catalog with improved accessibility. Before the new catalog was implemented Preety had to physically visit the library to receive assistance in searching and locating material. Now she can search the catalog on her own using her mobile phone, tablet, or laptop. Preety still struggles with spelling but has found that search functionality that suggest alternative spellings and provide error corrections are very helpful and greatly improve her experience. For more information on implementing techniques that remove barriers for Preety, see the following resources: Sections related to Preety Diverse Abilities and Barriers Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD (Cognitive disabilities) Dyslexia (Cognitive disabilities) Tools and Techniques Captions (Perception) Screen reader (Perception) Text-to-speech (Perception) Pop-up and animations blockers (Presentation) Reading assistants (Presentation) Spelling and grammar tools (input) Consistency and predictability (Interaction) Helpful error and success messages (Interaction) Keyword search (Interaction) Multiple navigation mechanisms (Interaction) Accessibility principles: Text alternatives for non-text content (Perceivable) Content can be presented in different ways (Perceivable) Users have enough time to read and use the content (Operable) Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are (Operable) Content is readable and understandable (Understandable) Content appears and operates in predictable ways (Understandable) Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes (Understandable) Content is compatible with current and future user tools (Robust) Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss Yun is an 85 year-old with reduced vision, hand-tremor, and mild memory loss; common age-related impairments for someone his age. Yun regularly browses the web reading news sites. In recent years he also started using social media to stay in touch with his family and friends. He maintains his own blog where he posts articles on art history and other topics he enjoys. Like many older individuals, Yun has difficulty reading small text and clicking on small links and form elements. His daughter showed him how to enlarge text in the web browser, which works well on many websites. He encounters problems when text does not reflow when it is enlarged and he is forced to scroll back and forth to read the enlarged content, which means he easily loses track of his place. He also has problems with CAPTCHA images found on many social media sites. The text is so distorted, even when he enlarges it, that he often cannot accurately enter the text. He has a better experience on sites that use alternative CAPTCHA options, unfortunately only a small number currently do. Yun’s daughter gave him a special mouse that is easier to control with his hand tremors. He also uses a web browser that saves thumbnail images of his frequently visited sites, which makes it easier for him to keep track of the sites he goes to most often.

Luis works at a market, bagging groceries for customers. Typically he buys his groceries at the same market where he works, but he is sometimes confused by the large number of product choices and sometimes has problems finding his favorite items when the store layout is changed. Recently, a friend showed him an app for online grocery purchases that has consistent, easy-to-use navigation with clear and direct instructions. Luis is able to add the list of his most frequently purchased items into the app and save it for additional purchases. He also likes the search functionality that makes suggestions for mistyped or misspelled words. The app also keeps a running total of the items in his virtual shopping cart which helps him keep up with how much he is spending. His friend also showed him several accessibility features in his mobile phone that he finds very helpful including word prediction which provides a selection of possible word choices based on the first characters he enters and the text-to-speech functionality which allows him to listen to reviews posted by other users on the grocery app. With the use of these tools, Luis has begun posting his own reviews of items he has purchased. Luis now uses the shopping app a couple of times a month for frequently purchased items and buys a few fresh items regularly from the store where he works. For more information on implementing techniques that remove barriers for Luis, see the following resources: Sections related to Luis Diverse Abilities and Barriers Down syndrome (Cognitive disabilities) Tools and Techniques Easy-to-read text (Presentation) Pop-up and animations blockers (Presentation) Progressive disclosure (Presentation) Reading assistants (Presentation) Reduced interface (Presentation) Accelerators (Input) Spelling and grammar tools (Input) Consistency and predictability (Interaction) Descriptive titles, headings, and labels (Interaction) Helpful error and success messages (Interaction) Multiple navigation mechanisms (Interaction) Accessibility principles: Content can be presented in different ways (Perceivable) Users have enough time to read and use the content (Operable) Users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are (Operable) Content is readable and understandable (Understandable) Content appears and operates in predictable ways (Understandable) Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes (Understandable) Content is compatible with current and future user tools (Robust) Kaseem, teenager who is deaf and blind Kaseem is a teenager who is deaf and recently became legally blind too, which means she can see only small portions of a screen and read text when it is significantly enlarged. Kaseem uses: screen magnification software to enlarge the text on websites to a suitable font size; screen reader software that displays text on a refreshable Braille device; large computer screen with high resolution and high luminosity (brightness). Kaseem’s portable electronic Braille notetaker includes a calendar, e-mail, web browsing, and note-taking functionality. Her mobile device includes GPS which helps her orient herself and navigate around the city. Kaseem uses the public transportation online site to plan her trips and view bus schedules, but encounters problems when she enlarges the text and it does not reflow or wrap properly, making the maps very difficult to use. She has a better experience viewing the train schedules that are properly marked up and allow text reflow. Kaseem found the web team contact information listed at the public transportation website and sent a message to the team informing them of the problems she encountered using their site. She also sent them the link to the train website and described how that site works better for her. She recently received an email message thanking her for her information and informing her that the public transportation web team plans to implement accessibility improvements in the launch of their new website.

    "text": "Weave accessibility implementation throughout the process to minimize overhead and improve the overall quality of the final outcome. Prioritize quick wins and communicate progress to increase commitment and develop a sense of accomplishment. Build skills and expertise Improve accessibility awareness and develop core skills for key staff. Develop the accessibility skills of everyone involved, including designers, developers, content creators, and managers. This includes providing training for existing staff, as well as including accessibility skills in staff recruitment criteria. Examples of training include: Introductions to accessibility for everyone How accessibility benefits your business for management and project managers Accessible visual design for designers and marketing Accessible coding solutions for developers and testers Writing accessible content for non-technical content authors Document and share experience gathered throughout the processes to build expertise in creating accessible websites. Consider how to capture and communicate lessons learned, successful approaches, and good techniques. Include what didn’t work, as well as what did, to avoid time being spent on approaches known to have problems. Training is an initial investment that pays off as understanding of accessibility increases and it becomes more common practice. Increase knowledge should result in more accessible implementations first time, helping to reduce evaluation and rework costs and limit risk. For more information Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training – Provides guidance on creating training programmes customized to your particular needs. Tips for Getting Started with Web Accessibility – These tips introduce some basic considerations for making your website more accessible to people with disabilities. Web Accessibility Tutorials – Provides guidance on how to create specific components of websites to meet WCAG 2. Before and After Demo – Shows an inaccessible website and a retrofitted version of the same website with annotations. Integrate goals into policies Create a policy framework that builds accessibility throughout the organization. Integrate the goals from your accessibility policy within other organizational procedures and policies. This will help spread the responsibility but also ensure that accessibility is considered as an integral part of day-to-day activities. The following are some examples of where incorporating accessibility can bring broad benefits. Recruitment policies – Include relevant accessibility skills in general recruitment briefs and policies, to support the recruitment of staff expertise. Staff training – Provide accessibility training as part of staff and career development plans, to support the development of staff expertise. Document publishing process – Incorporate accessibility checks as part of your web content publishing workflow, to ensure that good practice is maintained and that final web content continues to be accessible. Procurement process – Ensure that suppliers are aware of your accessibility requirements by including criteria in any request for quotations and contracts. Depending on your organization there may be several other relevant procedures or policies that involve accessibility, such as equal employment policies, workspace accommodation, and customer care. Related activities Plan: Create accessibility policy Assign tasks and support delivery Assign tasks according to the set objectives and identified responsibilities. Track progress on the tasks and provide support where needed. Communicate deliverables and assignments to assigned team members. Ensure staff know what is expected of them, that they have the necessary capabilities, and are clear on schedules. Ensure that everyone has the resources to help them with their tasks. Provide a clear process for people to flag issues and ensure that any issues raised are managed and responded to efficiently. Individuals in multi-disciplinary teams are likely to have responsibility for meeting different parts of your accessibility standard. Be specific about each individual’s responsibility. For example, visual designers may be responsible for success criteria concerned with the visual elements of content, and developers are concerned with those related to the underlying code. Similarly, a contracts team may be responsible for ensuring that the procurement process includes accessibility requirements for third-party content. Depending on organization size, you may consider an accessibility task force that meets regularly to coordinate and verify progress among departments. Related activities Plan: Assign responsibilities Plan: Review websites For more information Improving the Accessibility of Your Website – Provides steps to help respond to immediate accessibility barriers. Involving Users with Disabilities – Describes how to involve users to help better understand accessibility issues. WCAG Overview – Provides information on WCAG, how it is structured, and how best to use it. How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) – A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2. Evaluate early and regularly Find and fix issues early in the process to reduce risk and cost. Evaluate accessibility throughout the design and development process, and particularly at key milestones and sprints. Evaluate key web pages, processes, and stand-alone components as they become available. Avoid evaluating accessibility separately and integrate checks iteratively within any current testing and quality assurance processes. Early evaluations of designs help identify problems and potential problems before significant work takes place. Other design resources, such as personas and user stories, can also be reviewed to include accessibility considerations. This will help designers better understand how people with disabilities interact with your website. Include input from users with disabilities as part of your evaluations. Encourage team members to attend testing sessions as this provides insight and context into barriers experienced by users. Use a standard report structure to capture evaluation findings. This allows for comparisons between different websites and across versions of the same website. Raise accessibility issues in an issue tracking system to ensure that it is allocated resources and fixed as part of the standard quality assurance cycle. Related activities Plan: Establish monitoring framework For more information Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility – Provides simple steps to help assess if a web page addresses accessibility. WCAG-EM Overview – Introduces a methodology for determining how well a website conforms to WCAG 2. Involving Users with Disabilities – Describes how to involve users to help better understand accessibility issues. Prioritize issues Use resources effectively by addressing high impact, easy-to-resolve issues first. While all accessibility objectives will need to be met, prioritizing can help you achieve them more effectively. Examples of prioritization include: Start with issues that are easier to fix, to help build motivation in the team and demonstrate success. Prioritize the development of accessible templates and components to support the creating of accessible content. Prioritize visual design to synchronize with an on-going re-branding activity within the organization. Prioritize recruitment or procurement policies to support anticipated hiring and acquisitions. De-prioritize issues that are related to tools or systems, such as a content management system (CMS), that are expected to be changed soon anyway. Involve different perspectives, including internal and external stakeholders, in the prioritization process. Review the situation regularly to benefit from arising opportunities. For more information Prioritize Solutions section of Improving the Accessibility of Your Website – Describes further prioritization criteria. Track and communicate progress Monitor progress towards accessibility goals and share the good and bad to maintain awareness and support. Track the progress made towards your accessibility objectives according to the assigned responsibilities and planned schedule. This includes progress on: Web content accessibility Implementation of procedures and policies Staff training and knowledge sharing Organizational awareness and attitude Share accessibility achievements, in particular with management, to help maintain and increase support for accessibility activities. Communicating lack of achievement can help highlight insufficient support or other systemic challenges and focus management on the need for urgent attention. Regular communication can help make the benefits of and challenges with accessibility implementation more transparent and easier to understand by your peers. For example, sharing successful training sessions, resources, and tools across departments could leverage knowledge and skills. Possible communication opportunities include: Reporting issue clearance rate to project management. Share highlight videos from user experience sessions with accessibility champions. Developer workshops to share good practice approaches. Related activities Initiate: Set objectives Plan: Establish monitoring framework",

    "text": "To succeed, a web accessibility effort must be well grounded in organizational culture, process, and practice. To do this, align accessibility with existing organizational approaches; develop and communicate clear, measurable objectives; and engage stakeholders to secure understanding and broad support throughout the organization. Learn the basics Find out what accessibility is and why it is important. The better you and your colleagues understand accessibility, the more effectively it can be implemented and promoted in your organization. Deepening your understanding of web accessibility helps you to address issues more effectively. Some sources for learning the basics include: Research introductory articles and videos Talk with colleagues, friends, and family members with disabilities Find training appropriate for your particular role Seek information or training from accessibility and disability organizations Set up assistive technology demonstrations and let people try them out First-hand experience of how people with disabilities access web content is often enlightening and inspiring. This can help you and others to understand the benefits and value of accessibility. What is web accessibility? Web accessibility fulfills the basic promise of the web - making information and communication readily available to all people regardless of barriers in geography, language, or disability. Integrating accessibility into websites brings broader benefits to organizations and other website visitors. For example, easier code maintenance and better user experiences, particularly on mobile devices. Related activities Implement: Build skills and expertise For more information Introduction to Web Accessibility – Introduces web accessibility and links to additional resources. How People with Disabilities Use the Web – Explores the impact of accessible design with real-life examples. Explore the current environment Learn the organization’s current state of accessibility and obligations to help determine the scope of work ahead. Explore and learn the current state of accessibility in your organization to help when initiating discussions with stakeholders, such as management. Several aspects of web accessibility can be checked fairly easily, with little or no technical skills required. This includes cursory checks of: Key websites and website user activities Web content policies and processes, such as those related to editing and publishing General awareness of and attitude towards accessibility and disability Understanding of accessibility law and policy as they effect your organization You may not be in the position to explore all these aspects in a first attempt. However, the more information you can gather, the better you will understand the types and sources of the issues that need to be addressed. Related activities Plan: Review websites Plan: Review environment For more information Easy Checks - A First Review of Web Accessibility – Provides simple steps to help assess if a web page addresses accessibility. Set objectives Clear objectives identify key deliverables, establish a timeline, and define how to measure success. Create objectives in response to identified accessibility problems and organizational goals. Develop measurable objectives that address accessibility gaps within the organization’s web content, processes, and policies. Objectives help to focus your team, clarify what activities need to be planned, define required deliverables, and ensure that successful delivery can be determined. Ensure that objectives have management agreement and support. This will help secure the necessary resources, align accessibility and business objectives, and reinforce your strategy. Also ensure that objectives help integrate accessibility into existing project frameworks, production workflows, or quality assurance processes. Examples of objectives might include: Develop accessibility policy by year-end. Include accessibility clauses in procurement within 6 months and enforce for all new Web procurement activities by year-end. Evaluate primary website and address any Level A and AA non-conformancies within 18 months. Prepare and deliver accessible writing course for all content authors by May. Modify design approval process to include accessibility considerations before June. Develop business case A strong business case helps gain buy-in from stakeholders and can make accessibility an organizational priority. Develop a tailored business case to respond to why accessibility should be addressed within your organization. The business case will be used to persuade stakeholders and management that web accessibility should be financially supported and prioritized. Depending on organizational priorities, the business case should explore: Direct impact for users with disabilities Broader benefits for everyone, such as usability Financial, time, and resource costs associated with not addressing accessibility early Legal aspects that may be applicable to your organization Impact on corporate social responsibility The business case should also outline the risks associated with ignoring accessibility, provide some indication of the resources needed, and specify how improvements will be tracked, and anticipated return on investment.

Mobile Accessibility – Summarizes existing and developing resources related to mobile accessibility. Web Accessibility and Older People – Introduces how the accessibility needs of older people with age-related impairments overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Raise awareness Communicate the goals, value-adds, and importance of accessibility throughout the organization. Lack of awareness is a frequent reason for lack of accessibility adoption. Many people may know little or nothing about accessibility. Some may not appreciate that their role has an impact on website accessibility. Others may not be aware of the additional value that accessibility brings. A general introduction to accessibility, including organizational goals, will benefit everyone in the organization by improving awareness and building enthusiasm for the task. Consider audience needs and interests as you raise awareness of the benefits of web accessibility. Management will need to know about risk, budget, policy, and return on investment but designers may engage with understanding and solving the design challenges of accessibility. Developers may also enjoy the challenge of making modern designs accessible using new skills in HTML5, JavaScript, and ARIA. Marketing may be interested in user stories and demonstrating corporate responsibility. Consider inviting guest or expert speakers to organizational or departmental events to talk about accessibility. For more information Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training – Provides help on developing training on web accessibility. Gather support Organization-wide support is vital to ensure accessibility is distributed across the organization and sustained. Key stakeholder and management support will simplify the process of introducing or improving accessibility. Management support will help with prioritization clashes, access to resources, and communication activities. Use the business case to help secure support from these groups. Support for accessibility is often found among other project teams involved in the creation of websites. Encourage interest in these groups by exploring how accessibility has broad benefits. For example, individuals can improve their skills, organizations improve their websites, and people with disabilities have a better online experience. This will help increase the enthusiasm for accessibility and create more advocates or champions. Create opportunities to exchange information and provide support. This could be informal between interested individuals, such as chat channels and lunch gatherings, or more formal presentations to management during staff meetings or feedback sessions.

    "text": "Careful planning is critical to effective implementation of any accessibility effort. It ensures a clear assessment of the required work, distribution of tasks, and continual follow-up on progress. Create accessibility policy Document the accessibility goals, scope, and responsibilities important to your organization. A web accessibility policy captures your goals and targets. Policies vary across organizations but at a minimum establishes what web accessibility standard you aim to conform to and by when. For example, your policy might only state that your website will meet all criteria specified in WCAG 2.1 Level AA within one year. A policy may cover other topics such as roles and responsibilities, content preparation processes, quality assurance, infrastructure, and reporting. Ensure the policy has approval and backing from management. This will help all implementation activities, ensuring that resources are available and activities are prioritized. For more information Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility – Provides information on what needs to be considered when creating your policy. Assign responsibilities Understand what roles are needed to ensure all tasks are covered. Responsibility for delivering accessibility needs to be assigned to specific individuals and incorporated into their job description. Formalizing the responsibility helps ensure that the individual has time for the work and can receive training. Clear identification also helps communicate who is responsible for accessibility and that it is being prioritized. It is important to recognize that implementing accessibility is not only a concern for developers, but for the whole team. Spreading responsibilities throughout your project and organization increases awareness and reduces the risk of the activities overwhelming an individual or team. Some example responsibilities include: Marketing – Embed accessibility within brand or design guidelines. Quality assurance – Test for and track accessibility issues within the code. Development – Maintain code libraries with accessible components. Purchasing – Ensure that organizational accessibility policy is incorporated within procurement processes. Acceptance testing – Ensure that any agency-delivered website or component meets your desired level of accessibility. Recruitment – Incorporate accessibility skills within recruitment profiles. Determine budget and resources Ensure resources, including budgets, are clarified and secured for accessibility activities. This includes necessary reviews, training, audits, and testing with users. Your budget and resource needs depend on your accessibility goals and the extent of the work required to achieve them. For all activities consider what resources will be required and ensure that that they are available. Some things that need to be considered include: Accessibility evaluations – Consider how frequently they need to occur and how extensive they need to be. Evaluation with people – Consider what opportunities exist to involve users with disabilities in evaluations. Reviews of policies and procedures – Time required to determine which policies need to be change, time required to make the changes, and time required to implement the changes. Recruitment – Organizations and teams may benefit from recruiting accessibility specialists or coordinators. Staff training – General awareness raising as well as specific training targeted on the needs of particular activities, such as website development or content writing. Tooling – Adaptation or possible replacement of content authoring tools, such as the content management system (CMS), or acquiring accessibility evaluation tools. Experienced support – Additional external support may be necessary while staff skills and knowledge improves. Once the budget is determined, ensure that you have sufficient approval. Your business case helps to secure budget, and you should ensure that the final budget is supported by estimates of how changes impact on previously set objectives and targets, and what return on investment could be expected. This might include better website performance, reduction in maintenance costs, higher sales, improved visitor statistics, or improved corporate social responsibility.

Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility – Provides information on the benefits of involving users and how to do it. Review environment Consider resources, processes, and tools in your organization that may impact accessibility efforts. The environment in which your websites are created and maintained has an equally significant impact on their accessibility. Also review these surrounding aspects, including: How well authoring tools support you in creating and maintaining accessible content; for example, does the content management system (CMS) support your accessibility commitments? What is the level of accessibility knowledge and expertise of the staff creating and maintaining your websites? How well is training support provided to improve the situation? Do staff have access to appropriate tools to assist in testing accessibility? Can accessibility be improved in design and development guidelines and specifications, shared templates and coding libraries, common authoring practices, and other centralized resources? Does any quality assurance plan include specific accessibility checks? How well do the existing policies and processes support your undertaking; for example, are there procurement policies to ensure purchasing of accessible tools and content? Having clear understanding of the issues will help you better address them. For example, you may identify that by improving the content management system (CMS) or with training, you can achieve your accessibility objectives much more effectively.

Web Accessibility Evaluation Tools List – List of vendor provided tools that help support accessibility evaluations. ATAG Overview – Provides information on Authoring Tools Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), how it is structured, and how best to use it. Review websites Identify issues to be fixed or avoided in existing websites. Perform a detailed accessibility review of websites in the scope of your objectives. This can create a baseline for future work, identify where training or additional expertise is needed, and help clarify how big a problem exists. The review may highlight instances of good practice, which identifies staff or suppliers who have critical skills to build on. Review results are helpful to identify problems to be avoided in future work, even if the objectives involve completely replacing an existing website. Results are also helpful in stakeholder reporting activities. Highlight existing problems and their impact so that later on, the impact of positive change can be put into context. Accessibility checks can be performed at all stages of the process, not only when the website is completed. For example, color choices can be checked on mocked-up website designs. By starting early and checking throughout the project you reduce the risk of being constrained by early design decisions that become expensive to change later on. Expert assistance may be required if your available resources do not have the skills and experience needed to undertake a thorough review. For more information WCAG-EM Overview – Introduces a methodology for determining how well a website conforms to WCAG 2. Assess the Situation – Describes how you might approach evaluating your website. Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility – Describes the benefits of involving users in projects and how to go about it. Establish monitoring framework Create a standard way of monitoring and reporting findings, in order to track and progress. Defined milestones help you measure your progress. Ensure that each milestone has specific and measurable criteria to indicate what progress has occurred. Some example criteria include: Number of WCAG 2 Success Criteria passed, and their level. Number of complaints received related to accessibility. Calls handled from people who were unable to process their application online. Positive social media comments on accessibility of service. Training sessions on accessibility delivered to the staff. Ensure that accessibility progress is part of standard reporting for all parts of your organization that have been assigned any accessibility responsibility. It is valuable to develop a standard report structure to capture the measure of accessibility for websites or tools. This allows for comparisons between different websites and also between different versions of the same website. For long-term or ongoing goals you need to plan regular monitoring to ensure that achieved goals do not slip. For example, updates to content and website maintenance work may introduce new accessibility barriers or new staff may not have the necessary skills. Plan for regular reviews to monitor progress over time. Ensure that responsibility is assigned for the checks and there are clear escalation paths for identified issues. Related activities Initiate: Set objectives Implement: Evaluate early and regularly Engage with stakeholders Maintain long-term support through regular communication with management and other stakeholders. Engage with your stakeholders to bring them on board and to identify how they can help you meet your accessibility goals. This includes internal stakeholders such as project teams, marketing, and management, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers, advocacy groups, and customers. For example: Introduce accessibility aspects in marketing campaigns. Report progress to management. Negotiate with suppliers to better support you with accessibility. Find out the latest accessibility trends for advocates and champions. Provide feedback channels to engage with your customers and end-users. Communicate your efforts publicly to help set expectations and increase internal commitment for accessibility. A public accessibility statement that identifies parts of your websites that work well and less well, explains accessibility improvements to come, and provides contact options for customers to report problems can help you overcome the transition period and gather feedback to prioritize repairs.",

    "text": "Keeping momentum helps with the accessibility maintenance for completed projects and builds on completed work for new projects. Regular reviews of content, organizational processes, and resources will help ensure that accessibility remains a priority and issues are identified. Developing a management reporting process will help ensure that it is clear where activity is required for follow-up work. Monitor websites Changing content can introduce accessibility issues, and provide opportunities for improvement. Monitor changes to identify issues and solutions. Coordinate closely with website owners to identify opportunities for improvement. This includes daily content publishing and maintenance activities, as well as broader redesign and development efforts. For example, knowing when website updates are scheduled and their scope can help reprioritize accessibility tasks to minimize effort. As your website content changes, ensure that regular accessibility reviews are performed. Include accessibility checks within the publishing process to help reduce the risk of issues occurring. Also provide a consistent evaluation process and reporting template. This will help comparison of findings to identify trends across websites or teams and help in management reporting activities. Reviews should seek to identify issues and also identify why those issues are occurring. Some questions to consider: Are issues caused by staff members who have not had sufficient training? Are they as a result of a change in the content management system (CMS)? Are the requirements of the publishing process unclear? Take action to correct the issues and also to remedy the reason for the issues occurring. Related activities Plan: Establish monitoring framework Engage with stakeholders Work with stakeholders to continually prioritize accessibility. Continued engagement with stakeholders will ensure that they are aware of the improvements in accessibility and resulting benefits. Internal stakeholders may be interested in how this is impacting the business and the effects on key performance indicators. External stakeholders are more likely to be interested in how your organization is progressing towards fulfilling stated accessibility goals. Keep working with external suppliers to improve the services and tools that they deliver. Work with internal stakeholders to ensure that accessibility remains a priority, particularly when it comes to new projects. Long-term engagement should also consider how accessibility changes are impacting project delivery. Are projects costing more? Is less time needed to ensure that accessibility is covered? Are there less problems at the end of projects? Changes in organizational structure may also be considered in the long-term and require the strategic view that senior stakeholders have. Examples include: Provide subject matter experts within each development team. Build accessibility support services within the organization. Prioritize accessibility during restructuring. Related activities Initiate: Gather support Track standards and legislation Keep up-to-date with changes to ensure that you are responding to the latest requirements. Review changes in standards and legislation that form part of your Accessibility Policy and consider any new standards or legislation that might add to your policy. These may have a broad impact on how you manage accessibility and will need to be planned with care. Create a process to track changes in standards that provides you with sufficient opportunity to respond in good time. Changes in legislation tend to include dates by which compliance must be achieved. This can be helpful if you need to gather support, and will usually require involved planning to ensure that changes are implemented in time. Standards may change to cover additional areas of accessibility or respond to new technology. This might require new design and coding approaches for existing websites. Also review any existing common libraries, knowledge bases, and training material to ensure that the current standards are correctly reflected. For more information WAI Interest Group – Public group with a mailing list for general discussion on Web accessibility and W3C standards announcements. Adapt to new technologies Update resources and websites in response to changes in web technologies. Consider what technologies you aim to support and ensure that you track functionality that changes each version. This will include what baseline browsers and assistive technologies you support and also the authoring tools that you use, such as your content management system. Baseline support list Update the list of browsers and assistive technologies that are supported for website development. New versions will bring new features and improved support for existing standards. Consider what additional accessibility support new versions will bring and determine what additional work might be needed to take advantage of them. Any work can then be fed into the next iteration of the site. Similarly, new versions of your authoring tools may provide additional accessibility features that you can take advantage of. You may need to update training or provide extra training so that content authors are able to use new features. Consider suggesting accessibility improvements back to authoring tool vendors. Hardware Upgrades to hardware are generally less frequent than software changes, but should also be considered. This includes new consumer devices intended to access the Web as well as new assistive technologies. Explore new technology as it becomes commonly available and consider what changes might be necessary to support accessibility. For assistive technologies, consider working with advocacy organisations to identify new technologies and what changes may be necessary to support them. Incorporate user feedback Invite user feedback and use it to help guide improvement activities and identify areas in need of attention. Ensure that any on-going customer support is able to respond to user accessibility issues. This will include training for first line support and also clear escalation paths for issues that cannot be resolved immediately. Inform the user who raised the issue of any escalation that requires more involved changes and when improvements might be expected. Communicate accessibility improvements on your website in the Accessibility Statement. Make it easy for website users to submit feedback on accessibility and ensure that any feedback is used when considering future improvements.

Relevant WCAG 2 Resources: From Understanding WCAG 2.0: Understanding Conformance Understanding Accessibility Support Workshop review and lessons learned — Day 3 Session 5 Target audience: Web developers and application programmers Session Objectives: Ensure participants have understood the key messages from the workshop Provide an opportunity for questions and answers to outstanding issues Outline: General questions and answers (Q&amp;A) to elaborate on anything needing clarification Summary of the overall requirements for accessible web design and development Reiteration of the value of using “How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference)” as a gateway to WCAG 2 Opportunities for follow-up, including the WAI Interest Group (and the associated WAI-IG email list) Suggested activity: Ask participants to write down something they learned in the last two days that they will incorporate in their work immediately, something that surprised them, or the most interesting thing they learned. Discuss some of the impressions from the participants to share lessons learned. Important Notes This example workshop is not a complete set of training material. Trainers will need to adapt the material to suit their audience. For example, for an in-house workshop, trainers should focus on the issues most common to the organization’s content and development environment, and could use the organization’s website and authoring tools for examples and activities. This material assumes that trainers are experienced web accessibility practitioners and trainers. That is, it does not attempt to train trainers. This outline is for an initial workshop. Follow up workshops might be needed. For example, content authors would benefit from specific instruction on how to use their content management system (CMS) or other authoring tools to provide accessible content. Additional notes for presenters for the technical sessions on days 2 and 3 Allow time at the end of each session to sum up the requirements and clarify any issues arising from the session. Finish days 1 and 2 with a brief summary of the day, and start days 2 and 3 with a brief summary of the previous day. Seek feedback at the end of each day and adjust remaining material as appropriate. Clarify that not all WCAG 2 success criteria are being presented and discussed in this workshop. Describe the intent of accessibility requirements, and their relationship to barriers for people with disabilities and older people. Also describe the broader benefits for mobile users, search engine optimization (SEO), and more. Draw illustrative examples from sites and material that are relevant to the participants backgrounds, e.g. government, commerce, etc. The Before and After Demonstration provides accessible and inaccessible web pages, including evaluation reports, that can be used as examples. Using the participants’ own websites or similar websites to theirs (such as websites from competitor organizations) helps make the examples more tangible. Emphasize the benefits of How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference), a customizable quick reference to WCAG 2 requirements and techniques, including ‘best practice’ advisory techniques. Introduce appropriate evaluation techniques and tools for each issue as it is covered. Carry out activities and exercises to reinforce the learning effect.",

    "text": "Summary This page introduces some basic considerations to help you get started making your user interface design and visual design more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements. Follow the links to the related WCAG requirements, detailed background in the “Understanding” document, guidance from Tutorials, user stories, and more. Page Contents Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background Don’t use color alone to convey information Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify Provide clear and consistent navigation options Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels Provide easily identifiable feedback Use headings and spacing to group related content Create designs for different viewport sizes Include image and media alternatives in your design Provide controls for content that starts automatically Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background Foreground text needs to have sufficient contrast with background colors. This includes text on images, background gradients, buttons, and other elements. This does not apply for logos, or incidental text, such as text that happens to be in a photograph. The links below provide more information on the minimum contrast ratio as required by the WCAG and how to check contrast. “Contrast ratio” is a short version of the more technically correct term “luminance contrast ratio”. Example: Contrast ratio Insufficient Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance. Sufficient Some people cannot read text if there is not sufficient contrast between the text and background. For others, bright colors (high luminance) are not readable; they need low luminance. More Information WCAG Contrast (Minimum) 1.4.3 (Understanding 1.4.3) User Story How a user with “color blindness” experiences the Web Easy Check How to check contrast ratio Support Tools List of tools to help determine contrast ratio Don’t use color alone to convey information While color can be useful to convey information, color should not be the only way information is conveyed. When using color to differentiate elements, also provide additional identification that does not rely on color perception. For example, use an asterisk in addition to color to indicate required form fields, and use labels to distinguish areas on graphs. Example: Using color to convey meaning Color only Required fields are in red Name Email Color and symbol Required fields are in red and marked with an * Name Email * Example: Refer to something using color alone Color only Four triangles with different angles Which is the right-angled triangle? Green Blue Red Yellow Don't know Color and number 1Green triangle: Angles are 30°, 60°, 90° 2 Blue triangle: Angles are 30°, 30°, 120° 3 Red triangle: Angles are 30°, 60°, 90° 4 Yellow triangle: Angles are 40°, 70°, 70° Which is the right-angled triangle? Green (1) Blue (2) Red (3) Yellow (4) Don't know More Information WCAG Use of Color 1.4.1 (Understanding 1.4.1) User Story How a user with “color blindness” experiences the Web Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify Provide distinct styles for interactive elements, such as links and buttons, to make them easy to identify. For example, change the appearance of links on mouse hover, keyboard focus, and touch-screen activation. Ensure that styles and naming for interactive elements are used consistently throughout the website. Example: Unique styles for different link states Style links to stand out from text Some people can't use a mouse and use only a keyboard to navigate through web pages. It is important that users can reach all interactive elements using the keyboard, and that it is clear which element has focus. Visible keyboard focus could be a border or highlight that moves as you tab through the web page. Mouse hover style keyboard to navigate Keyboard focus style keyboard to navigate Touch or click style keyboard to navigate More Information WCAG Focus Visible 2.4.7 (Understanding 2.4.7) Consistent Identification 3.2.4 (Understanding 3.2.4) User Story: Challenges faced by someone with a limited ability to use a mouse Challenges faced by an older user with hand tremors Provide clear and consistent navigation options Ensure that navigation across pages within a website has consistent naming, styling, and positioning. Provide more than one method of website navigation, such as a site search or a site map. Help users understand where they are in a website or page by providing orientation cues, such as breadcrumbs and clear headings. More Information WCAG Consistent Navigation 3.2.3 (Understanding 3.2.3) Multiple Ways 2.4.5 (Understanding 2.4.5) User Story How consistency and navigation can help someone with cognitive difficulties Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels Ensure that all fields have a descriptive label adjacent to the field. For left-to-right languages, labels are usually positioned to the left or above the field, except for checkboxes and radio buttons where they are usually to the right. Avoid having too much space between labels and fields. Example: Labels and input fields associated by proximity Add a comment Your E-mail I am happy for you to contact me Your Website Comment More Information WCAG Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Headings and Labels 2.4.6 (Understanding 2.4.6) Tutorial Visual position of label text User Story How clear labelling can help someone with cognitive difficulties Provide easily identifiable feedback Provide feedback for interactions, such as confirming form submission, alerting the user when something goes wrong, or notifying the user of changes on the page. Instructions should be easy to identify. Important feedback that requires user action should be presented in a prominent style. Example: Using error list, icon, and background color to make errors stand out Please correct the following errors: Email address is invalid A Comment is required Add a comment Required fields are in red and marked with an * Name E-mail * Website Comment * More Information WCAG Error Identification 3.3.1 (Understanding 3.3.1) Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Error Suggestion 3.3.3 (Understanding 3.3.3) Tutorial User Notifications User Story How making important content easily identifiable can help Use headings and spacing to group related content Use whitespace and proximity to make relationships between content more apparent. Style headings to group content, reduce clutter, and make it easier to scan and understand. Example: Spacing highlights relationship between content Little spacing and unclear relationship Single heading with large blocks of text, poor separation of sub-headings, and unclear image relationship Main heading Sub heading Sub heading More spacing and clearer relationship Main heading, multiple sub headings, lists, and no large text blocks Main heading Sub heading Sub heading More Information WCAG Headings and Labels 2.4.6 (Understanding 2.4.6) Section Headings 2.4.10 (Understanding 2.4.10) Tutorial Headings User Story Describes how headings can be helpful for navigation Create designs for different viewport sizes Consider how page information is presented in different sized viewports, such as mobile phones or zoomed browser windows. Position and presentation of main elements, such as header and navigation can be changed to make best use of the space. Ensure that text size and line width are set to maximize readability and legibility. Example: Content and navigation adapt to smaller mobile screen Display in a wide window with small text uses multiple columns for primary content, visible navigation options, and visible secondary information. Display in a narrow window, such as a mobile phone, or with large text uses single column for primary content, navigation options are revealed using an icon, and secondary information is also revealed via icon. More Information Background Small Screen Size Mobile considerations related to Understandability User Story Describes how alternative views of zoomed pages can be helpful Include image and media alternatives in your design Provide a place in your design for alternatives for images and media. For example, you might need: Visible links to transcripts of audio Visible links to audio described versions of videos Text along with icons and graphical buttons Captions and descriptions for tables or complex graphs Work with content authors and developers to provide alternatives for non-text content. Example: Design includes links to a transcript and to an audio described video More Information WCAG Non-text Content 1.1.1 (Understanding 1.1.1) Tutorial Images User Story Describes the value of text alternatives to a blind user Provide controls for content that starts automatically Provide visible controls to allow users to stop any animations or auto-playing sound. This applies to carousels, image sliders, background sound, and videos. Example: Show play/stop and selection controls in carousel design More Information WCAG Audio Control 1.4.2 (Understanding 1.4.2) Pause, Stop, Hide 2.2.2 (Understanding 2.2.2) Tutorial Carousel Concepts Learn More About Accessibility These tips are a few of the things you need to consider for web accessibility.

    "text": "Summary This page introduces some basic considerations to help you get started developing web content that is more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements. Follow the links to the related WCAG requirements, detailed background in the “Understanding” document, guidance from Tutorials, user stories, and more. Page Contents Associate a label with every form control Include alternative text for images Identify page language and language changes Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure Help users avoid and correct mistakes Reflect the reading order in the code order Write code that adapts to the user’s technology Provide meaning for non-standard interactive elements Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible Avoid CAPTCHA where possible Associate a label with every form control Use a for attribute on the &lt;label&gt; element linked to the id attribute of the form element, or using WAI-ARIA attributes. In specific situations it may be acceptable to hide &lt;label&gt; elements visually, but in most cases labels are needed to help all readers understand the required input. Example: Using for and id attributes Rendered Username Code Snippet &lt;label for=\"username\"&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt; &lt;input id=\"username\" type=\"text\" name=\"username\"&gt; More Information WCAG Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) Tutorial Labeling Controls Include alternative text for images Ensure that alternative text for images is added to all informational and functional images. Use empty alternative text, alt=\"\" for decorative images, or include them in the CSS instead. Text alternatives are usually provided by those responsible for written content. More Information WCAG Non-text Content 1.1.1 (Understanding 1.1.1) Tutorial Images User Story Describes the value of text alternatives to a blind user Identify page language and language changes Indicate the primary language of every page by using the lang attribute in the html tag, for example &lt;html lang=\"en\"&gt;. Use the lang attribute on specific elements when the language of the element differs from the rest of the page. More Information WCAG Language of Page 3.1.1 (Understanding 3.1.1) Language of Parts 3.1.2 (Understanding 3.1.2) How To Declaring language in HTML Use mark-up to convey meaning and structure Use appropriate mark-up for headings, lists, tables, etc. HTML5 provides additional elements, such as &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;aside&gt;, to better structure your content. WAI-ARIA roles can provide additional meaning, for example, using role=\"search\" to identify search functionality. Work with designers and content writers to agree on meanings and then use them consistently.

When font size is increased by at least 200%, avoid horizontal scrolling and prevent any clipping of content. Use progressive enhancement to help ensure that core functionality and content is available regardless of technology being used. Example: Using media queries to adapt navigation /* On narrow viewports, make the navigation full width */ @media screen and (min-width: 25em) { #nav { float: none; width: auto; } #main { margin-left: 0; } } /* On wider viewports, put the navigation on the left */ @media screen and (min-width: 43em) { #nav { float: left; width: 24%; } #main { margin-left: 27%; } } More Information WCAG Resize text 1.4.4 (Understanding 1.4.4) Consistent Identification 3.2.4 (Understanding 3.2.4) Background Small Screen Size User Story Describes how alternative views of zoomed pages can be helpful Provide meaning for non-standard interactive elements Use WAI-ARIA to provide information on function and state for custom widgets, such as accordions and custom-made buttons. For example, role=\"navigation\" and aria-expanded=\"true\". Additional code is required to implement the behavior of such widgets, such as expanding and collapsing content or how the widget responds to keyboard events. Example: Menu function and state identified using WAI-ARIA &lt;nav aria-label=\"Main Navigation\" role=\"navigation\"&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Shop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li class=\"has-submenu\"&gt; &lt;a aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-haspopup=\"true\" href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBears&lt;/a&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBear 6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;SpaceBear 6 Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;MarsCars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"...\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/nav&gt; More Information WCAG Name, Role, Value 4.1.2 (Understanding 4.1.2) Background Notes on Using ARIA in HTML Ensure that all interactive elements are keyboard accessible Think about keyboard access, especially when developing interactive elements, such as menus, mouseover information, collapsable accordions, or media players. Use tabindex=\"0\" to add an element that does not normally receive focus, such as &lt;div&gt; or &lt;span&gt;, into the navigation order when it is being used for interaction. Use scripting to capture and respond to keyboard events. Example: Keyboard accessible menu button Rendered Menu About News Tickets Fun Code Snippet var buttonExample = document.getElementById('example-button'); buttonExample.addEventListener('keydown', function(e) { // Toggle the menu when RETURN is pressed if(e.keyCode &amp;&amp; e.keyCode == 13) { toggleMenu(document.getElementById('example-button-menu')); } }); buttonExample.addEventListener('click', function(e) { // Toggle the menu on mouse click toggleMenu(document.getElementById('example-button-menu')); }); More Information WCAG Keyboard 2.1.1 (Understanding 2.1.1) User Story Describes how a user with RSI needs keyboard support Avoid CAPTCHA where possible CAPTCHAs create problems for many people. There are other means of verifying that user input was generated by a human that are easier to use, such as automatic detection or interface interactions. If CAPTCHA really needs to be included, ensure that it is simple to understand and includes alternatives for users with disabilities, such as: Providing more than two ways to solve the CAPTCHAs Providing access to a human representative who can bypass CAPTCHA Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users.

    "title": "Tips for Getting Started Writing for Web Accessibility",
    "text": "Summary This page introduces some basic considerations to help you get started writing web content that is more accessible to people with disabilities. These tips are good practice to help you meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) requirements. Follow the links to the related WCAG requirements, detailed background in the “Understanding” document, guidance from Tutorials, user stories, and more. Page Contents Provide informative, unique page titles Use headings to convey meaning and structure Make link text meaningful Write meaningful text alternatives for images Create transcripts and captions for multimedia Provide clear instructions Keep content clear and concise Provide informative, unique page titles For each web page, provide a short title that describes the page content and distinguishes it from other pages. The page title is often the same as the main heading of the page. Put the unique and most relevant information first; for example, put the name of the page before the name of the organization. For pages that are part of a multi-step process, include the current step in the page title. Example: Page Titles Home page title Space Teddy Inc. Page name followed by organization name Latest News &bull; Space Teddy Inc. Page name including step in a process Buy Your Bear (Step 1 of 3) &bull; Space Teddy Inc. More Information WCAG Page Titled 2.4.2 (Understanding 2.4.2) Use headings to convey meaning and structure Use short headings to group related paragraphs and clearly describe the sections. Good headings provide an outline of the content. Example: Using headings to organize content Lack of headings View inline example Example: Headings and Subheadings HTML elements provide information on structural hierarchy of a document. Using elements correctly will help convey additional meaning to assistive technology. In many cases, doing so will also make your document easier to edit. For documents longer than three or four paragraphs, headings and subheadings are important for usability and accessibility. They help readers to determine the overall outline of a document and to navigate to specific information of interest. Headings are classified into levels from one to six. The highest level is \"Level 1\" and often corresponds to the title of the page or major document section. Sub-headers proceed through increasing header levels. The lower the number, the smaller and more detailed a section. Visual readers identify headers by scanning pages for text of a larger size or a different style. Assistive technology users are not able to see these visual changes, so changing the style is not a sufficient cue. Instead, the headings must be semantically \"tagged\" so that assistive technology can identify headings. This can be presented to the user as a navigation aid. This makes adding headings one of the most important tools for a screen reader user so that he or she can learn what is on the page. Note that tagging usually triggers a formatting change visually which can be adjusted in many documents.

Avoid using ambiguous link text, such as ‘click here’ or ‘read more’. Indicate relevant information about the link target, such as document type and size, for example, ‘Proposal Documents (RTF, 20MB)’. Example: Using link text to describe target page No information For more information on device independence, click here. Meaningful information Read more about device independence. More Information WCAG Link Purpose (In Context) 2.4.4 (Understanding 2.4.4) Link Purpose (Link Only) 2.4.9 (Understanding 2.4.9) Write meaningful text alternatives for images For every image, write alternative text that provides the information or function of the image. For purely decorative images, there is no need to write alternative text. Example: Using alternative text to communicate important information Uninformative Charging the phone: Connect the phone to a power outlet using the cable and power adaptor provided. Alternative text for image: \"Charging phone\" Informative Charging the phone: Connect the phone to a power outlet using the cable and power adaptor provided. Alternative text for image: \"Plug cable into the bottom edge of the phone.\" Alternative text is usually not visible; it is included in this example just so you can see what it is. More Information WCAG Non-text Content 1.1.1 (Understanding 1.1.1) Tutorial Images User Story Describes the value of text alternatives to a blind user Create transcripts and captions for multimedia For audio-only content, such a podcast, provide a transcript. For audio and visual content, such as training videos, also provide captions. Include in the transcripts and captions the spoken information and sounds that are important for understanding the content, for example, ‘door creaks’. For video transcripts, also include a description of the important visual content, for example ‘Athan leaves the room’. More Information WCAG Captions (Prerecorded) 1.2.2 (Understanding 1.2.2) Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded) 1.2.3 (Understanding 1.2.3) User Story Describes how captions help a deaf student Provide clear instructions Ensure that instructions, guidance, and error messages are clear, easy to understand, and avoid unnecessarily technical language. Describe input requirements, such as date formats. Example: Instructions communicate what information the user should provide Password should be at least six characters with at least one number (0-9). Password Example: Error indicates what the problem is and, possibly, how to fix it The username 'superbear' is already in use. The password needs to include at least one number. More Information WCAG Labels or Instructions 3.3.2 (Understanding 3.3.2) User Story Describes simple instructions help someone with learning difficulties Keep content clear and concise Use simple language and formatting, as appropriate for the context. Write in short, clear sentences and paragraphs. Avoid using unnecessarily complex words and phrases. Consider providing a glossary for terms readers may not know. Expand acronyms on first use. For example, Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Consider providing a glossary for terms readers may not know. Use list formatting as appropriate. Consider using images, illustrations, video, audio, and symbols to help clarify meaning. Example: Making content readable and understandable Unnecessarily complex CPP: In the event of a vehicular collision, a company assigned representative will seek to ascertain the extent and cause of damages to property belonging to all parties involved. Once our representative obtains information that allows us to understand the causality, we may or may not assign appropriate monetary compensation. The resulting decision may occasion one of the following options: the claim is not approved and is assigned a rejected status, the status of the claim is ambiguous and will require additional information before further processing can occur, the claim is partially approved and reduced payment is assigned and issued, or claim is fully approved and total claim payment is assigned and issued. Easier to understand Claims Processing Procedure (CPP): If you have a car accident, our agent will investigate. Findings will determine any claim payment. This could result in: Approved claim - full payment Partially approved claim - reduced payment Undetermined claim - more information needed Rejected claim - no payment More Information WCAG Reading Level 3.1.5 (Understanding 3.1.5) Unusual Words 3.1.3 (Understanding 3.1.3) Abbreviations 3.1.4 (Understanding 3.1.4) User Story User with reading disabilities benefits from easy to read text Learn More About Accessibility These tips are a few of the things you need to consider for web accessibility.

    "text": "Page Contents About Approach Title Options References Open Issues ChangeLog Requirements Groupings option Presenting the Success Criteria (or Guidelines) within Impairment &amp; Needs Groupings Alternative Success Criteria Rationale Expressions Published Version: http://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users/developing About In some situations, developers are tasked to create Web sites optimized for older users. Often they are not aware of the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence of standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would explain to them how they could benefit from implementing existing Web accessibility guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible Web sites for older users. Scenarios Jane DeVeloper has been told to make her website work well for older users. This document should show her how to use WCAG as her guide for doing so. Jane has a sister Jessica, also a web developer: Jane needs to design her website for older people; she is not aware of accessibility or WCAG Jessica knows about accessibility and WCAG; she wants to get information specifically on designing for older users The web manager at Acme insurance wants to better meet the needs of older people as one of their key customer groups. This doc should help him integrate the requirements of old people into their ongoing accessibility work. Researcher looking to develop guidelines/recommendations for older web users. This document should demonstrate how WCAG 2.0 covers the accessibility requirements. Purpose, Goals, Objectives Rationale: Many web developers: do not appreciate the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older people do not know about the accessibility requirements of older users with changing abilities do not understand the importance of the WCAG 2.0 advisory techniques Some independent ‘senior friendly’ guidelines have been developed which parallel WAI guidelines, but fragment standardization efforts Objective: Underline the relevance of the WAI guidelines for older users Provide web developers with information about the importance of WCAG 2.0 for older users Highlight the relevance of advisory techniques from WCAG 2, especially for people who do not use assistive technology Contribute to the harmonization of web accessibility rather the development of separate recommendations for older users Catch people focusing on older audience and show that WCAG provides what they need (and by the way, make it accessible to everyone while you’re at it) Audience Primary: Web developers (including web application programmers, website designers, information architects, content writers and editors, etc) primary group - people developing for older people and unaware of WCAG secondary group - accessibility aware, but looking for older people guidance Secondary: Website procurers and commissioners Policy makers Managers &amp; other decision makers Advocates and older peoples’ organizations Scope Will: Highlight aspects of WCAG 2.0 of particular importance to older users with accessibility needs due to ageing Provide tips and best-practices for website development, including WCAG 2.0 sufficient &amp; advisory techniques Point to further resources about website development, especially those developed through WAI-AGE Will not: Be a step-by-step guide to accessible development Repeat material already included in other WAI documents (but will cross reference them, especially WAI-AGE ones, as appropriate) Approach Initial outline and ideas: Introduction stress overlap of requirements for older users and people with disabilities consider mentioning: many previous studies made recommendations WRT older people that are covered or paralleled by WCAG 2.0 many of the identified requirements for older web users are met by advisory techniques Background stress importance of WAI guidelines (refer Lit Review) mention the importance of the browser and UAAG for people who don’t use assistive technologies point to How People with Disabilities Use the Web point to Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization: Overview Requirements / Mapping / @@ mapping of needs and requirements with WCAG 2.0 drawn from WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature Review (draft) and related documents probably simplified - maybe by GL/SC and particular technique of additional importance Implementation (tips and best practices) mention the importance of content authors, writers, editors, and others preparing content in addressing requirements of older users mention importance of authoring tools (include CMS) in achieving web accessibility - point toSelecting and Using Authoring Tools for Web Accessibility Mention possibility of utilising WAI-ARIA (e.g. to make sure the user notices small ajax-created page changes/updates) mention importance of site design and information architecture in addressing requirements of older users reference BAD as an example of good implementation point to Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility point to Implementation Plan for Web Accessibility point to Evaluating Web Sites for Accessibility point to Developing Organizational Policies on Web Accessibility point to Why Standards Harmonization is Essential to Web Accessibility Title Options WCAG for Older Users (technical page): Primary ideas Developing Websites for Older People Developing Websites for Older People: Applying the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies How WCAG 2.0 Improves Websites for Older People How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 has it Covered\\ How WCAG 2 Covers it\\ Using WCAG 2 to Meet the Needs\\ How WCAG 2 covers what you need to know\\ How WCAG 2 Addresses their Needs\\ Using WCAG 2 to Address their Needs Improving Usability Through Accessibility Guidelines for Meeting the Needs of Older Web Users Meeting Their Accessibility Needs How WCAG 2 Meets Their Accessibility Need Optimizing Websites for Older People Older People and Web Design Older People and Web Design: Applicability of WCAG 2 guidelines Meeting the Requirements of Older Web Users Other thoughts: Developing Websites Suitable for Older People Developing Accessible Websites for Older People Designing Websites for Older Users, People with Disabilities, and All/Everyone best practice design … top tips for … applicability of WAI guidelines for older people Applicability of WCAG 2 guidelines to older users Designing for Older Users and Web Accessibility Older Users Needs Met with Web Accessibility Accessibility and older users/people EOWG Brainstorm (technical page OR landing page) See also title ideas for Older People land page below References WAI-AGE task force and EOWG Discussions: EOWG teleconference 24 September 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 8 September 2010 EOWG teleconference 3 September 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 11 August 2010 EOWG teleconference 6 August 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 28 July 2010 EOWG teleconference 23 July 2010 EOWG teleconference 25 June 2010 EOWG teleconference 18 June 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 2 June 2010 EOWG teleconference 28 May 2010 EOWG teleconference 21 May 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 19 May 2010 WAI-AGE TF teleconference 5 May 2010 Related documents: Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review Needs for older users (2008) WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature Review (2009) Comparative requirements analysis for older web users (2008) WCAG 1.0 checkpoints – mapping to ageing recommendations (2008) Additional requirements suggested by ageing recommendations (2008) Requirements identified from targeted studies (2008) BAD-TF: Implementing WAI-AGE Requirements (2009) Open Issues consider later adding a complete list of Techniques applicable - maybe create a separate page and link to to it later on (EOWG 25 June 2010) DONE - consider later restructuring the document along the lines of “the types of needs older users have, then show how WCAG SC apply to those under that” [this is closer to the approach in http://www.w3.org/WAI/WAI-AGE/comparative.html] tried with 4-Aug-2010 draft (trial at Requirements Grouping trial below) adopted and progressed to final draft (Sept 2010) DONE -

It highlights the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities, and guides the readers to more in-depth resources such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0, the WAI-AGE Literature Review documents, or other relevant resources. Proposal: In some situations, developers are tasked to create Web sites for older users. Often they are not aware of the relationship between the accessibility needs of older users and the needs of people with disabilities. In fact, they may not even be aware of the existence of standards for Web accessibility at all. This resource would explain to them how they could benefit from existing Web accessibility guidelines, and how to use them to create accessible Web sites for older users. Requirements Groupings option A second attempt to organise material by the types of needs older users have, then show how WCAG 2.0 meets those needs. Trying the approach and presentation style used in Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities. Groupings based on WAI Guidelines and Older Web Users: Findings from a Literature Review plus meeting identified impairments. Techniques drawn from early draft of Developing Websites for Older People (June 2010). Need to emphasize that any success criteria not listed still need to be met! Questions: Is this ‘requirements’ approach working? Is the organisation/categorisation good? (Too many? Too few?) Is the level of explanation of each requirement sufficient? Might it be appropriate to link to the Lit Review for each requirement? How best to include success criteria that don’t readily fit into the proposed categories? @@ *--- start requirements groupings trial ---* ### Perceivable [definition: ]{.os}Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.[ end definition]{.os} #### Text size Many older people experience declining eyesight that requires larger text within web pages. **WCAG 2.0 requirements:** - [1.4.4 - Resize text](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-scale) (AA)\\ - [1.4.8 - Visual Presentation](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast-visual-presentation) (AAA) **Techniques to consider:** - Providing large fonts by default (future link) - [](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/C17)Avoiding scaling font sizes smaller than the user-agent default (future link) - [G178: Providing controls on the Web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G178) - [C17: Scaling form elements which contain text](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/C17) - [G179: Ensuring that there is no loss of content or functionality when the text resizes and text containers do not resize](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/NOTE-WCAG20-TECHS-20081211/G179) - Ensuring that text in raster images is at least 18pt (future link) [\\[@@ different form the following - reported \\]]{.open} - Making sure any text in images of text is at least 14 points and has good contrast (future link) #### Text style and presentation A number of studies recommended specific preferred text presentation styles for older people; other approaches identified here will make text easy to read.\\ \\[@@ a number of studies have identified that overly decorated text can be difficult to read \\] Open items: - bold and underline - ??

Option 1: Meeting this SC will … Sensory Characteristics - Success Criterion 1.3.3 (A) {#sensory-characteristics—success-criterion-1.3.3-a .listintro} Meeting this criterion will benefit older people experiencing sensory declines who may not see or hear well. Timing adjustable - Success Criterion 2.2.1 (A) {#timing-adjustable—success-criterion-2.2.1-a .listintro} Meeting this success criterion will improve usability for older people whose vision decline makes reading difficult, or whose cognitive decline affects their concentration or short-term memory. On Focus - Success Criterion 3.2.1 (A) {#on-focus—success-criterion-3.2.1-a .listintro} Meeting this criterion will increase accessibility for older people experiencing declining cognitive abilities or [ experiencing difficulty with forms]{.listintro}. The advisory techniques will benefit those older people observed to experience difficulties with new browser windows, for example: Giving users advanced warning when opening a new window. (future link) [advisory] Option 2: Older people experience X with Y implication, so do Z Sensory Characteristics - Success Criterion 1.3.3 (A) {#sensory-characteristics—success-criterion-1.3.3-a-1 .listintro} Older people experiencing sensory declines who may not see or hear well will benefit from this criterion. Timing adjustable - Success Criterion 2.2.1 (A) {#timing-adjustable—success-criterion-2.2.1-a-1 .listintro} Many older people experience vision decline that can make reading difficult, and might also experience various cognitive declines affecting their concentration or short-term memory. These impairments can mean that some older people might need longer to read, understand and complete online tasks than others. On Focus - Success Criterion 3.2.1 (A) {#on-focus—success-criterion-3.2.1-a-1 .listintro} Older people can experience declining cognitive abilities and [have been observed to sometimes experience difficulty with forms]{.listintro} so using “activate” rather than “focus” as a trigger for changes of context and not causing persistent changes of state or value when a component receives focus can be helpful. Older people have been observed to experience difficulties with new browser windows, so providing advanced warning and only using these when when best from an accessibility perspective is good practice. — end Alternative Success Criteria Rationale Expressions —   {#lp}Landing Page for Older Users ----------------------------------- Published: &lt;http://www.w3.org/WAI/older-users&gt; **Purpose:** - to act as an introductory page to the overlap between design for older users and web accessibility - to link to WAI resources that specifically address issues with designing for older users **Audience:** - everyone interested in developing websites that meet the needs of older users **References:** - [EOWG minutes 21 May 2010](http://www.w3.org/2010/05/21-eo-minutes.html) - [EOWG minutes 12 Feb 2010](http://www.w3.org/2010/02/12-eo-minutes.html#item02) - [Feb 2010 version](http://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/older-users2010-02Feb-12) **Title considerations (landing page):** - Design for Older Users and Web Accessibility Overlaps - Web Accessibility and Older Users - Designing for Older Users and Web Accessibility Overlaps - Overlaps in Designing for Older Users and Web Accessibility - Web Accessibility and Older People - Web Accessibility and Older People: Existing Guidelines for People with Disabilities Meet the Needs of Older Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Broadening Access to Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Providing Access to Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Ensuring Access for Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Guidelines and Access for Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Requirements of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Needs of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Guidelines for meeting the Needs of Older Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Resources for meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users - Web Accessibility and Older People: Best Practices for meeting the Needs of Older Web Users &lt;/div&gt;",

    "title": "Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies",
    "text": "Summary An extensive literature review identified that existing standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address the accessibility needs of older web users. This page introduces how to use Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 to improve the accessibility and usability of websites and web applications for older people. Please see Web Accessibility and Older People: Meeting the Needs of Ageing Web Users for additional background and resources on the overlapping needs of older people and people with disabilities. Page Contents About WCAG 2.0 How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People Perceivable information and user interface Text size Text style and text layout Color and contrast Multimedia Text-to-speech (speech synthesis) CAPTCHA Operable user interface and navigation Links Navigation and location Mouse use Keyboard use and tabbing Distractions Sufficient time Understandable information and user interface Page organization Understandable language Consistent navigation and labeling Pop-ups and new windows Page refresh and updates Instructions and input assistance Error prevention and recovery for forms Robust content and reliable interpretation Older equipment/software About WCAG 2.0 The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 includes organizing principles and guidelines, and has success criteria at three levels: A, AA, AAA. WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. A related document provides techniques that include specific details on meeting the success criteria, such as code examples. WAI encourages developers to use the How to Meet WCAG 2.0 quick reference to access the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques, along with the additional descriptions, examples, and resources from “Understanding WCAG 2.0”. To learn more about WCAG, see: WCAG Overview - provides background, an introduction to WCAG, and links to additional information The WCAG 2.0 Documents - describes the different WCAG 2.0 technical and supporting documents How to Meet WCAG 2.0 - is a customizable quick reference to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 requirements (Success Criteria) and techniques How WCAG 2.0 Applies to Older People This section explains how many of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 guidelines and success criteria specifically meet the needs of older web users. Although not all the WCAG 2.0 success criteria are listed here, WAI recommends meeting at least all WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA success criteria. Some of the Level AAA success criteria that are particularly important for older people are listed in this section too. When implementing WCAG 2.0, developers can use different techniques to meet the success criteria. In some cases, using one technique instead of another can optimize accessibility for certain users. This section lists some of the techniques that can help optimize websites for older people. (Many of the techniques link to additional information; those with “(future link)” will be written up with later edits to the WCAG Techniques.) This section is organized under the four principles of web accessibility from WCAG 2.0: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. Success criteria are listed thematically, to help readability. Sometimes they are drawn from different guidelines to address a particular aspect. Perceivable information and user interface Text size Many older people require large text due to declining vision, including text in form fields and other controls. WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 1.4.4 - Resize text (AA) says “text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality” Example techniques to consider: Using relative font-sizes such as percent (C12) or ems (C14) and ensuring text containers resize (C28) Providing large fonts by default (future link) C17: Scaling form elements which contain text Avoiding the use of text in raster images (future link) G178: Providing controls on the Web page that allow users to incrementally change the size of all text on the page up to 200 percent More techniques are listed under 1.4.4 - Resize text in “How to Meet WCAG 2.0”. Literature review reference: Vision decline with ageing. Text style and text layout Text style and its visual presentation impacts how hard or easy it is for people to read, especially older people with declining vision. WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 1.4.8 - Visual Presentation (AAA) includes requirements on text style, text justification, line spacing, line length, and horizontal scrolling Example techniques to consider: Avoiding fully-aligned text (C19) or center-aligned text (future link) Using readable fonts (future link) Using upper and lower case according to the spelling conventions of the text language (future link) Avoiding chunks of italic text (future link) G188: Providing a button on the page to increase line spaces and paragraph spaces Providing sufficient inter-column spacing (future link) Avoiding overuse of different styles on individual pages and in sites (future link) More techniques are listed under 1.4.8 - Visual Presentation in “How to Meet WCAG 2.0”. Literature review references: Vision decline with ageing, Previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ Web guidelines, and Studies of elderly Web users’ specific disabilities - Vision. Color and contrast Most older people’s color perception changes, and they lose contrast sensitivity.

Text-to-speech (speech synthesis) Some older people use text-to-speech (speech synthesis) software, which is becoming increasingly available in browsers and operating systems. WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 1.1.1 - Non-text Content (A) says “a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose” is required 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships (A) says “information, structure, and relationships” to be made available, for example to text-to-speech software Example techniques to consider: G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content H44: Using label elements to associate text labels with form controls H42: Using h1-h6 to identify headings More techniques are listed under 1.1.1 - Non-text Content and 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships in “How to Meet WCAG 2.0”. CAPTCHA Older people with declining eyesight may not be able to discern the characters in a CAPTCHA, especially because CAPTCHAs often have low contrast and do not increase in size when users have text sized larger. CAPTCHA stands for ‘Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart’. An example of CAPTCHA is: WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 1.1.1 - Non-text Content (A) includes a requirement for alternative CAPTCHAs Example techniques to consider: G143: Providing a text alternative that describes the purpose of the CAPTCHA AND G144: Ensuring that the Web Page contains another CAPTCHA serving the same purpose using a different modality Providing more than two modalities of CAPTCHAs (future link) Providing access to a human customer service representative who can bypass CAPTCHA (future link) Not requiring CAPTCHAs for authorized users (future link) Literature review reference: Vision decline with ageing. Operable user interface and navigation Links Many older people need links to be particularly clear and identifiable due to declining vision and cognition. WCAG 2.0 success criteria: 2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context) (A) requires that the purpose of a link can be determined from the link text alone, or from the link text together with its surrounding context 2.4.9 - Link Purpose (Link Only) (AAA) says “a mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone” 2.4.7 - Focus Visible (AA) requires a visible keyboard focus indicator that shows what component on the web page has focus Example techniques to consider: G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link Limiting the number of links per page (future link) Making links visually distinct (future link) G195: Using an author-supplied, highly visible focus indicator Highlighting a link or control when the mouse hovers over it, or when it receives keyboard focus (future links) More techniques are listed under 2.4.4 - Link Purpose (In Context), 2.4.9 - Link Purpose (Link Only), and 2.4.7 - Focus Visible in “How to Meet WCAG 2.0”.

    "text": "Summary Designing products that are easier for older people to use is similar to designing for people with disabilities. Guidance on how to make your websites, web applications, and web tools work better for older users is covered in existing international accessibility standards from the W3C, including Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). Page Contents Background Overlapping Needs: People who are Elderly and People with Disabilities Guidelines and Other Standards Specific Guidance on Designing for Older Users Advocating and Educating Background Older web users are an increasing market segment and an important target group for many businesses, governments, and other organizations. The European Commission-funded WAI-AGE Project researched: the needs of older web users, existing guidance for addressing older user needs, and the overlap with web accessibility for people with disabilities. The results of the research and subsequent work determined that existing international accessibility standards from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) address most older user needs. More Background: Literature Review and Article Overview of \"Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review\" Provides a brief introduction of the scope, audience, and content of the Literature Review . Older Users Online - WAI Guidelines Address Older Users’ Web Experience (Originally published in User Experience Magazine, Vol 8, Issue 1, 2009) Explains age-related impairments that impact web use, requirements for web design that enhance the ability of older people to use the web and how existing accessibility guidelines for people with disabilities cover the needs of older users, and future work in this area. Overlapping Needs: People who are Elderly and People with Disabilities Many older people have age-related impairments that can affect how they use the web, such as declining: vision — including reduced contrast sensitivity, color perception, and near-focus, making it difficult to read web pages physical ability — including reduced dexterity and fine motor control, making it difficult to use a mouse and click small targets hearing — including difficulty hearing higher-pitched sounds and separating sounds, making it difficult to hear podcasts and other audio, especially when there is background music cognitive ability — including reduced short-term memory, difficulty concentrating, and being easily distracted, making it difficult to follow navigation and complete online tasks These issues overlap with the accessibility needs of people with disabilities. Thus, websites, applications, and tools that are accessible to people with disabilities are more accessible to older users as well. More About Older User Needs For statistics on the prevalence of age-related impairments and more on how they impact web use, see the Summary of Impact and Prevalence section of the Literature Review Overview. For short story (persona) showing some accessibility issues that an older person can face on the web, see Yun, retiree with low vision, hand tremor, and mild short-term memory loss in Stories of Web Users. If you want to learn about older users directly by including real people in your user studies, see Involving Users in Web Projects for Better, Easier Accessibility. For videos and descriptions of issues that impact people who are elderly and people with disabilities, see Web Accessibility Perspectives. These videos include older users: Customizable Text, Colors with Good Contrast, Notifications and Feedback, Understandable Content, and Large Links, Buttons, and Controls. Guidelines and Other Standards The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium that develops web standards. W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) focuses on making the web accessible to people with disabilities. Standards that are particularly relevant for older users include: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) WCAG materials include guidelines and techniques for making websites and web applications work better for people with disabilities, as well as for older users with accessibility needs due to ageing. User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) UAAG explains how to make web browsers and media players accessible. Browser features are particularly important to older users who have accessibility needs that should be met through browsers instead of requiring additional [assistive technologies](/wai-website/planning/involving-users/#at). Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Authoring tools are used to create web content. Examples of authoring tools are HTML editors and content management systems (CMS). Websites that let users add content &mdash; such as blogs, wikis, photo sharing sites, online forums, and social networking sites &mdash; are also authoring tools. These need to be accessible so that older people can use them. More About Standards For an introduction to accessibility guidelines and other standards, see W3C Accessibility Standards Overview. Specific Guidance on Designing for Older Users A key resource for designers, developers, managers, researchers, and others is Developing Websites for Older People: How Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 Applies. It: Introduces how to use WCAG 2.0 to improve the accessibility and usability of websites and web applications for older people. Is organized by user needs and WCAG principles. Lists specific WCAG success criteria and techniques that apply to improving the user experience of older people. Includes references to the Literature Review. Advocating and Educating The following resources can help promote accessibility for older users. Note: These resources have not been updated recently. Some details may be out of date, yet most of the general concepts still apply. Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization Includes the following sections that specifically apply: Overlap with Older Users' Needs and Access for Older People. Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer Provides guidance for users on how to set your computer to work better for your specific needs and preferences so it's easier to use websites; for example, enlarging text, making the mouse pointer bigger, and using the keyboard instead of the mouse to browse websites.",

    "text": "Summary This page introduces a review of literature about web accessibility and older users. It includes summaries of the impact and prevalence of ageing and: hearing loss vision decline physical decline cognitive decline Page Contents Introduction Who the Literature Review is For What is in the Literature Review Summary of Impact and Prevalence Status and Technical Report Format Who Developed the Literature Review Introduction Web Accessibility for Older Users: A Literature Review analyzes guidelines, professional articles, and scientific literature on the requirements of people with web accessibility needs related to ageing. Who the Literature Review is For The Literature Review itself is primarily for researchers and academics. The outcomes of the Literature Review are also being used to: promote accessibility solutions for older web users develop resources for users, industry, and others What is in the Literature Review The Literature Review summarizes: literature and statistics about how older adults use the Web age-related functional limitations requirements of older Web users The bulk of the Literature Review analyzes: existing literature reviews previous approaches to ‘senior friendly’ web guidelines relationship with WAI guidelines training older adults to use information and communications technology (ICT) and the web studies of older web users’ specific disabilities aspects of web design affecting the elderly involving the elderly in web design and development general usability studies involving elderly people A finding of the Literature Review is that existing WAI guidelines address many requirements of older web users. Yet, there is little reference to the WAI guidelines in literature and guidance covering the needs of older Web users. Summary of Impact and Prevalence This section provides summaries from the Literature Review. Ageing and Hearing Loss Impact of hearing loss: Audio can be difficult to discern Background sounds can be difficult to filter out Higher pitch sounds can be missed Prevalence of hearing loss: 47% of people 61 to 80 years experience some hearing loss 93% of people 81+ years experience some hearing loss Hearing starts to decline at around 50 years and affects a person’s ability to hear higher pitched sounds as well as discern the foreground from background audio such as music or other sounds. Some hearing loss is experienced by 47% of people 61 to 80 years and 93% of people over 81 years. Moderate or severe hearing loss or profound deafness is experienced by 20% of people aged 61 - 80 and 75% of people over 80. Ageing and Vision Decline Impact of vision decline: Decreasing ability to focus on near tasks Changing color perception and sensitivity Decreasing contrast sensitivity Prevalence of significant vision lose: 16% of people 65 - 74 years 19% of people 75 - 84 years 46% of people 85+ years Vision decline includes: Decreasing ability to focus on near tasks, including a computer screen Changing color perception and sensitivity - less violet light is registered, making it easier to see reds and yellows than blues and greens, and often making dark blue and black indistinguishable Decreasing contrast sensitivity from pupil shrinkage - resulting in the need for more light and higher contrast (an 80 year old typically has 80% less contrast sensitivity than a 20 year old) Vision decline often starts in a person’s mid-40s. 86% of Australians over 40 require reading glasses to correct for near vision. Significant vision loss (that can’t be corrected) affecting everyday life is estimated to affect 16% of people 65 to 74 years, and 46% of those over 85 years in the UK. Ageing and Physical Decline Impact of physical decline: Motor skill decline can result from many conditions including arthritis, essential tremor, and Parkinson’s Disease: Difficulty using mouse or keyboard Difficulty with clicking small targets Strain from non-ergonomic tasks Prevalence of physical decline: Conditions most commonly reported: Arthritis affects at least 50% of people over 65 Essential tremor affects up to 20% of people over 65 Parkinson’s Disease affects approximately 4% of people over 85 Motor skill decline impacts on dexterity and can result from many conditions, for example arthritis with associated joint stiffening and reduced fine motor control, and essential tremor or Parkinson’s Disease with associated hand trembling, making mouse use difficult or impossible for some and also affecting keyboard use. In particular, older people with physical impairments may have difficulty clicking small links, selecting radio buttons, and using many fly-out or pull-down menus. Arthritis is estimated to affect at least 50% of people over 65; essential tremor (one of many forms of tremor) is estimated to affect up to 5% of those over 40 and up to 20% of people over 65; and Parkinson’s affects around 4% of those over 85. Ageing and Cognitive Decline Impact of cognitive decline: Navigation, comprehension, and task completion can be affected by: Short term memory limitations Difficulty with concentration Distraction from movement or irrelevant material Difficulty coping with information overload Prevalence of cognitive decline: Conditions most commonly reported: Dementia (UK): 1.4% of people 65–69 years 24% of people 85+ years Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is more common: Around 20% of people over 70 years are estimated to experience MCI Cognitive decline is also common, though only dementia and mild cognitive impairment are commonly reported. While Dementia (including Alzheimer’s disease) is experienced by some older people (1.4% of people 65–69 years increasing to 24% of people over 85 years in the UK), forms of mild cognitive impairment (or MCI) are much more common, affecting over 20% of those over 70 years. MCI can result in: Short term memory limitations (which may result in a person forgetting the purpose of a website visit if they lose orientation on the site) Concentration and distraction issues (consider the volume of information on some pages, and the multiple animated advertisements that are sometimes present) Status and Technical Report Format The Literature Review was conducted in 2008. We do not currently plan to update it. Most of the information is still relevant. The Literature Review follows the W3C format for technical reports that includes several sections at the beginning: links to different versions, editors, copyright, abstract, and status. Who Developed the Literature Review The Literature Review was developed by the Education and Outreach Working Group (EOWG), with support of the WAI-AGE Project.",

More details are in About WAI IG below. Other Working Group Pages: Charter Discussion E-mail List Archives Announcements E-mail List Archives Mailing Lists There are two mailing lists: Announcements list (public-wai-announce) — for WAI announcements only. Discussion list (w3c-wai-ig) — for WAI announcements and public discussion. All e-mails sent to the Announcements list will also go to this Discussion list, so you don’t need to subscribe to both lists. If you want to send messages to the list, you must send them from an e-mail address that is subscribed to the list. Details are below. Announcements List - Subscribing and Unsubscribing To subscribe, send e-mail to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: “subscribe”. To unsubscribe, send e-mail to public-wai-announce-request@w3.org with subject: “unsubscribe”. You can also see the Announcements List Archives . Using the Discussion List Discussion List Archives are useful for searching for past messages and getting a feel for the list. E-mail messages should contribute to a comfortable, constructive exchange of ideas to advance web accessibility. Before you write an e-mail, think about how it will come across to the hundreds of people around the world who are on the list. Be respectful. Be positive. Be open to different perspectives. Provide constructive information. Focus on developing solutions, rather than just complaining. Avoid personal attacks, naming calling, and such. Explain the issue clearly. Provide sufficient background information. Make sure e-mails are related web accessibility and are appropriate for the WAI IG list. If you have questions about whether or not a message is appropriate for the WAI IG list, contact Shawn. When your comments are not useful for the entire list, reply off-list — that is, reply directly to the sender and do not send the message to the list. No soliciting. Formatting messages: Use a Subject line that describes the topic well. If you change topics, change the Subject. This is usually handled as follows: New Topic XYZ [was: Old Topic] Keep your reply comments near the top of a message, and only quote essential parts of a previous message at the top — so there are few quote markings for readers to wade through. If you use a vacation auto-responder, exclude responses to mail with w3c-wai-ig@w3.org in any header. Send any questions about the WAI IG mailing list to shawn@w3.org, not to the whole list. Subscribing to the Discussion List To subscribe to the list, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: “subscribe”. To unsubscribe from the list, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-request@w3.org with subject: “unsubscribe”. Please note: The subscription e-mail addresses are different from the e-mail address to send an e-mail message, which is in the next section. To subscribe to the email digest with compiled messages, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org with “subscribe” as the subject. To unsubscribe from the digest, send e-mail to w3c-wai-ig-d-request@w3.org with “unsubscribe” as the subject. Sending Messages to the Discussion List To send a message to the list, first subscribe to the list (instructions above), then send your message to w3c-wai-ig@w3.org The first time you send a message to a public W3C mailing list, you will get a reply e-mail asking if you will give permission for your message to be distributed to the list and thus go into the public archive. There is an option to do this once and then you don’t have to do it again in the future.

Calls for review of WAI documents are announced on the WAI Interest Group mailing list, W3C_WAI on Twitter, WAI Highlights RSS feed, and the WAI home page. Submitting Techniques for Implementing Guidelines WAI’s Web accessibility guidelines have associated Techniques documents that tell you how to meet the guidelines, such as Techniques for WCAG 2.0. You can submit ideas for new or updated techniques. There is a form for submitting WCAG 2.0 Techniques. To submit techniques for other guidelines, contact the Working Group’s Team Contact. Participating in Interest Groups The WAI Interest Group (WAI IG) is for general discussion and feedback on all areas of WAI’s work. Most of the interaction within WAI IG is through the public mailing list. Participating in Working Groups Anyone can join a WAI Working Group public mailing list, or read the public list archives. There are specific criteria for formally joining Working Groups, including requirements for participation and contribution. See the Working Group pages below to find what group best fits your interests, and to get information on participation and links to the mailing list archives. ARIA Working Group develops a suite of Accessible Rich Internet Applications resources, and accessible APIs and mappings. Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group reviews and comments on support for accessibility throughout W3C’s other working groups. Education and Outreach Working Group develops awareness, training, and implementation resources supporting Web accessibility. Web Content Accessibility Guidelines Working Group develops guidelines for Web pages, Web applications, and other Web content. Sponsoring WAI WAI’s work is supported in part by sponsorship from industry, disability, and government organizations interested in contributing to WAI’s efforts to make the Web more accessible. Please see the list of current sponsors on the WAI home page, and Sponsoring WAI for more information on WAI sponsorship. Promoting and Implementing Web Accessibility Promoting Awareness Tell people about WAI and web accessibility. Link to WAI’s home page and other relevant resources, including Finding Your WAI (shortened link: bit.ly/yourWAI). Cover web accessibility in presentations and training to web developers, designers, managers, and others. Put a WCAG logo on your website if it meets WCAG 2.0. Implementing Guidelines Use the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) documents to help make your website accessible. If you develop authoring tools—any software or service that people use to create or modify Web content, including content management systems—implement the Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG). If you develop Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, or other user agents—implement the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG). Encouraging Accessibility Encourage authoring tools to meet ATAG by directly contacting vendors and requesting increased accessibility support in future versions, and by purchasing tools that provide the best support for accessibility. Encourage Web browsers, media players, assistive technologies, and other user agents to meet UAAG. Encourage organizations to adopt an accessibility policy for their organization that defines their commitment to Web accessibility. Encourage websites to be accessible, for example, provide feedback on inaccessible websites and inaccessible Web products carefully; it is usually more productive to start with a positive encouraging tone, rather than a negative critical tone.",

Before we dig in to the details just to put in context the long road until where we are today, and that’s important just to put some things in context, some of these are relevant today. So some of this work on conformance testing started really long ago. It is as old as WCAG 1, maybe even before that when the Trace guidelines emerged. Some people were thinking about tooling and evaluation schemes and ways to test for these guidelines, for these requirements. So there was a lot of work early on by Len Kadsay who unfortunately passed away, Wendy Chishom and many others who wrote the techniques for accessibility evaluation and repair tools. Flowed in to development of WCAG 2.0 to make it testable. And if people remember the techniques themselves and the failures, they have some small procedures in there. So at least intent and idea was there. For quite awhile there was evaluation and repair tools working at W3C and that was focusing specifically on working with evaluation tool developers and looking at ways to improve automation and tool support, but also the consistency of evaluation and repair. And it was a lot of work there. It was also a lot of generations of different kinds of accessibility test tools and manual methodologies that emerged over the years and how the entire industry here of testing basically matured over the years as we went along. An important point I think is the so called WAB Cluster. It stands for Web Accessibility Benchmarking. And this was actually three projects funded by the European Commission that were asked to put together the so called Unified Web Evaluation Methodology, UWEM. We are going to look at that in the next slide in a bit more detail, but it is actually one of the important attempts to try to have a coordinated and aligned methodology for testing web content. And this was actually within these three projects together, there were maybe 24 European organizations in there and there was a lot of work put in to try to make that happen. And also one of the important things we are going to look at later is test samples for WCAG 2.0. One of the projects in this cluster, BenToWeb, and we have people on this project on the call today. So they may be clarifying some things. But those test samples are examples of good and bad content which were to test evaluation deals. So there was a lot of work put in to that and this is actually coming back in the ACT work through the idea of test cases. And we are going to look at that a little bit later on. A lot of the work that has happened in the past has helped inform our latest approach, our latest attempt and also some of the work invested in the past is stuff that we can take up on and build on for the new work that we are talking about here. Let me talk just a little bit about the Unified Web Evaluation Methodology. And this was an important step to try to align different practices that were going on in different European countries and to try to harmonize the approaches between them. In my view one of the challenges with that UWEM was it was trying to do many things at the same time. It was trying to be large scale monitoring. So having here an approach for large scale monitoring and the issue with large scale monitoring you are looking more for indicators rather than quality. You are not really looking at the specific state of a website, but you are trying to kind of have an idea how accessible is it and trying to relate the degrees of accessibility among different websites or different regions and so on. So this you kind of sacrifice a lot of the quality for scalability when you are doing such large scale. At the same time the UWEM was also trying to be a process for evaluating websites, qualitative to the evaluation for improvement. Somebody who wants to check their own website and see where they perform good, where they perform bad and what they need to fix. So the classical evaluation where people look at the site in detail to try to improve it. And last but not least there was also another attempt here on certification. And in certification again you have a slightly different view on evaluation where you are primarily looking for problems, just looking for issues, just trying to confirm whether no issues are found, you are not really trying to exhaustively find all types of issues or all issues because, you know, typically in certification you don’t even suggest the changes or the improvements. You just look for failures. And if there are none, then you issue the certificate. And if there are issues then you ask people to revisit their website. So and again all these three approaches are important for accessibility. But trying to combine them in one is really a challenge. I think each of these needs its own methodology and its own approach to accomplish, even if they are based on the same tests. And this is where this work comes in to try to have a basis tests that are common that can be used in different kinds of methodologies and scenarios. Another issue with UWEM is that it was based on WCAG 1 and we all know that WCAG 1 had a lot of difficulties with testability. Things like saying provide sufficient contrast was a big issue because it is not a testable statement. You don’t know how sufficient it is. And so that created a problem. So these were some of the issues of why UWEM had difficulty, but at the same time I think also during that stage there was not a lot of interest from I think particularly some of the industry organizations but many others as well to basically share, have a common understanding of testing. Many people felt that how they test a website and these checks are their assets, their know how and that they need to keep this to themselves because it is really how they differentiate themselves from their competitors or from the others or they invested so much in work that they don’t want to give it up. So these were some of the issues at the time that made it very difficult to really get people together and agree on one common approach. Moving on to slide No. 6 is really looking at the benefits of harmonization or the impact of fragmentation. What happens when people continue that whole process and have different evaluation results essentially, different understanding of accessibility, how they check something. And that really causes a lot of confusion among everyone involved in the development life cycle. And by developers here I mean the designers, front end, back end, the coders, the testers and so on. Really all the developers here but also suppliers to organizations. This happens very often. You are trying to plug in maybe something, some template or some tool, a player or something like that and that doesn’t meet your understanding of the requirements because the suppliers maybe have a different understanding of the accessibility requirements. And also third party evaluations when you are doing third party evaluations and there are differences. And that causes a lot of wasted effort. And we don’t have that many resources to spend in accessibility really to have duplicate efforts and these kinds of differences amongst us and in some cases actually it even causes loss of contracts. So when you are purchasing a website and then you run a tool over it or you do your testing, and you say hmmm, that’s not accessible and the other person says no, it is, according to there. And so, you know, maybe even lose contracts, but in any case a lot of wasted efforts and resources that are very rare and that we need to be careful of. But more importantly it reduces the credibility of accessibility for the entire field. It hurts us to have these differences in interpretation. And this is in the last years one of the big changes that is happening which is many more people are coming to the understanding including tool developers who for years and years were trying to distinguish themselves based on their testing interpretations are coming around to the conclusion that by having a more common understanding and reliability of how tools and methodologies perform the more basically the stronger the market is for everyone and the more benefits we all have from that. And there is still a lot of ways to differentiate also between methodologies. I’ll get in to that a little bit later. But the idea here is there should be different types of methodologies. Maybe they are going to be more educational. This is very often in say the educational sector or in the public sector where you are trying to get people to do evaluations who are not regularly accessibility experts but need to be able to check some of the content. And so these people need maybe very educational or basic methodologies that have a lot of explanation and hand holding and guidance. Now in other areas, let’s say in methodology for a certification authority where the primary users are accessibility experts who need to know what they need to check. And for them maybe such an educational methodology would be too verbose and would be too distracting and they want to have more, you know, exact information about what they need to test and that’s it. And they will just go through that. So there are different ways or different kinds of methodology that each have their place and the distinguishing factors between methodologies and tools should not be based on the interpretation of the results but on other factors. For tools there are things like the performance of tools and how well they fit in to your development process and many other things where tool makers can actually differentiate themselves. Also the coverage, how many tests they cover and so on. But it shouldn’t really be on interpretation. And so I think this is a major point here that as I said a lot of in the community is actually coming to that conclusion and so this has been a major step that led to this latest work on ACT, Accessibility Conformance Testing. Now meanwhile, on slide 7, while this was going on so to say in the evaluation area we also had the release of WCAG 2, the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, 2.0 in 2008 which as most of you will know has more testable requirements than WCAG 1 had. Also this notion of techniques and failures I think is very important. The idea is that you can extend, provide more detail as you go along as you find out things, as new technologies emerge. We saw the changes of HTML4 to HTML5, introduction of WAI ARIA and some of this WAI ARIA being integrated in to HTML5. Technology changes very quickly. And by having this idea that you can have techniques and failures that adapt to the current situation, the current technological situation but that the requirements themselves are more stable. This has proven to be really useful and something also where we as testers can come in and adhere to the testing aspects. So most of the time here we are looking at failures. A lot of the checks that we are talking about actually map to failures that the content does not meet. Also one of the important things about WCAG 2 is that since its release there has been much more international harmonization. Back then with WCAG 1 or several years ago there were many more derivatives of WCAG 1.0. The U.S. was different than Europe or the European Commission was saying. The individual European Member States have had different standards. Also around the world there were yet more different interpretations of WCAG 1 mixtures between WCAG 1 and WCAG 2. And so the situation was much more dire. It is not perfect yet. There are still issues and differences between countries. But there is certainly much more harmonization meanwhile which I think is a good situation to be in to know that these testing work we are doing would cover a much broader area, much broader market. So this strengthens our case and helps the work that we are doing. Also meanwhile there is Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology, WCAG EM. It is actually yet another different type of methodology. It doesn’t go in to the details of how to check individual requirements, but through the process of how to evaluate a website because WCAG focuses really on pages, on individual pages more. And this is a non-normative specification. So this is not a W3C standard, it is a so called Working Group Note that explains how to check a website, how to select individual pages from a website. So they are representative and so on. So that you can get to a useful answer at the end when you have done that of how accessible a website is. And meanwhile also there is a so called Auto-WCAG Community Group and I need to explain that a little bit. At W3C we have Working Groups which are established by the W3C membership to create a standard or a specification. Whereas a Community Group anybody can create, and anybody can get work started there. So this is kind of pre-standardization, what we call incubation. And when enough community interest in there or something really proves to be coming along then the membership may decide to make that actually in to a Working Group. This is actually how a lot of this latest work on Accessibility Conformance Testing started up. There was yet again another European funded project called EIII project. This project is one of the descendants of the WAB Cluster. Their focus here was on more the large scale monitoring of websites in regions. So what they were trying to do is basically create yet again a set of tests which they can run across sites, automated tests so they can run across sites to get an idea of how accessible they are. Instead of just doing that work within the project itself, they started the community group and actually also on the call today is Wilco Fiers who is the co-facilitator of that work today at W3C. They basically started to work in the open in this community group. And it started to gather momentum. People started to join that group. Started to discuss, started to exchange and again it was focused really on automated testing. Maybe in hindsight that name is a bit misleading because it has the automation kind of connotation whereas meanwhile we broaden the work much more. But anyway, that was really a kickstart in terms of having here something from the community where we could see that there is much more interest around this, around harmonizing than we had in the past, in the years before where people were really not as keen on having a common interpretation. So that takes us to slide 8, the creation of the Accessibility Conformance Testing work within W3C. As I said, this Auto-WCAG group and incubation work started to gather sufficient critical mass and there was enough membership within W3C to get that work started, a task force was created. This is W3C terminology, but basically a task force is a subgroup of a working group. So directly within the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group which is developing the accessibility guidelines. So developing WCAG. Directly embedded in there is this task force that’s tasked with Accessibility Conformance Testing. As I mentioned earlier, the co-facilitator here is not only Wilco Fiers but also Mary Jo Mueller from IBM who is also on the call today. These are the facilitators of the group but we have had a lot of involvement from other organizations, from Siteimprove, from the Daisy Consortium where they are looking at digital publishing, from Level Access. University of Illinois was participating and several others. I’m sorry that I’m forgetting some. And the mission of this task force is to develop three distinct things. First is the so called ACT Rules Format. The idea being here that if we want people to share their test rules and contribute them we need a common way of writing down these rules so that we can actually share them. So we can actually have people contributing these test rules. Another piece here to develop by the group is the ACT Review Process. So once somebody has contributed a rule, what should be the process from that contribution to make it in to a formal, a vetted and approved rule? And last but not least is actually those rules that get vetted and reviewed and approved to collect them and provide an open repository of such rules that people can take and use in their methodologies or in their test tools. All these pieces are in development. All these things are still in draft. So there is a lot of opportunity here to comment and provide input. A lot of moving pieces but it is firming up. And next on slide 9 maybe that gives hopefully a bit of an overview of how these things, how these pieces fit together. In the very bottom of this diagram is the ACT Rules Format. Again this is the common format of how you write down such rules and so that you can share them in to the repository and there can be different sources here. We have commitments from several different organizations. The commitment that they will be sharing rules. We also, since November 2017, have an EC funded project called the WAI-Tools Project supporting this work. Specifically this presentation today, this symposium is organized by this WAI-Tools Project. And I’ll mention more at the end about that. So we have several contributors here in order to accelerate the work. These different sources will be contributing ACT rules. And then on the left hand side is this vertical bar and that represents the ACT Review Process. That really takes it from the source to the review and vetting process in to the rules repository which already has implementations. So part of this review process is that you need to demonstrate implementation of these rules in order for them to be adopted in to the rules repository. And then we can have further implementations. The word implementation here applies to not only test tools but also to manual methodologies. That’s an important aspect here. That ACT Rules themselves are not intended to be used directly by evaluators. These are not what you actually go and test a website with, but these get interpreted in to a test tool or in to a methodology. Because you have the different flavors of methodologies and different flavors of tools. So the ACT Rules are really addressed more to people developing tools and developing methodologies rather than directly at the people carrying out evaluations. These implementations, these tools and methodologies are used by the evaluators. The hope here is that we have more consistent results between these different evaluations. Regardless which methodology you use or which tool you use you have more consistent results at the end. That’s the overall goal. Moving on to slide No. 10, I should mention, going in to the individual pieces here of this diagram is the ACT Rules Format, 1.0. This is a working draft which we have just published another version of on the 8th of March. Just a few days ago. The review period goes until 5th of April. So this is your opportunity to comment. I will remind you of this later on in the discussion. Really looking for feedback here, your input. It is starting to firm up. We hope that our next draft will be the last working draft and then we will be going in to the next level of maturity at W3C. And so we are making progress here. But we do need your input and actually specifically the purpose of this symposium today is to introduce most of you who, from seeing your responses, are involved in manual evaluation, manual testing. So we would like to know from people developing manual methodologies how does this really fit with, what you are trying to do with your development of methodologies and your development of test rules. So let’s have a look at the outline. These are the pieces on slide No. 11 that this rules format specifies, needs to be in an ACT Rule. First of all, a unique identifier. Every rule needs to have a unique identifier, descriptive title, and a description. The accessibility requirements that it maps to, things like which success criteria of WCAG does this address. Some limitations, assumptions or exceptions, accessibility support. Aspects under test. This is relevant for tools as well. So you are looking at the DOM tree. Are you looking at the direct HTTP response that you get from the server? Are you looking at the code or the rendered code? What is it that you are actually testing on the content and providing that information is really important. Also a very important concept and we are going to be talking about that in a little bit more detail in just a bit is the applicability and expectations. When we first started this work a lot of this was based on so called steps. Testing steps. Do this first; do this second; do this third. The issue with that is that it doesn’t map well to things like let’s say tools or approaches that are doing this, implementing this differently. Let’s say Artificial Intelligence or other types of testing that do not really have this procedural approach but looking more at what is it that I need to test. The concept of a rule group, of combining different rules together to get to a common test, to test particular requirements and finally test cases. And test cases that I have said much earlier those test samples. Test cases are examples of content that meet this rule and content that doesn’t. And that’s really, really important. This is how you check your implementation. Whether your implementation is a test tool or a methodology. This is how you check if you have the correct interpretation of the rule or not. Let’s look at a few examples just to make this a little bit more concrete. On slide 12. I’ll switch over to a browser. The first one we will be looking at is the ACT R2, which is a rule that we have published along with the rules format just to demonstrate how such rules would look like. This rule is called proper use of ARIA described by. What you are trying to check here is whether ARIA described by has been used properly or not. And what you have is the accessibility requirement, is which success criteria this really maps to and in this cases is success criteria 1.1.1 which is non-text content. You then have a description and some background, and some of the WCAG techniques and failures that it maps to. Some of the assumptions that you are making here in order to test. There are certain assumptions. What I talked about the aspects of the test, so in this case you are testing the DOM tree and the CSS styling. These things are defined in the rules format. Then the really important piece that I wanted to show is the applicability and the expectation. The applicability part you describe as precisely as possible the specific aspects that this rule applies to. So in this case it is an element with the semantic role of image that has a non-empty ARIA described by attribute. And it goes on. This is really what is applicable to. It makes it very specific what it is applicable to. And we moved away from what we previously had as things like CSS selectors or things to try to codify this. Because it has too many limitations and things that restrict the implementations, especially when we get in to things that are more manual or not fully automatible. Then you have the bunch of expectations which all need to be applied to this applicability in order for this test procedure to be checked. So, for instance, the first one is that each target element of this ARIA described by has a direct identifier. This is the first expectation. The second expectation, first of all, you have to fulfill the first expectation but also this described by ARIA attribute. So you write down the expectations of what you need to achieve. Now what you don’t do is you don’t say which tool you should use to do this or how to do it in a browser or so again this is not directly geared to the evaluators themselves but people who are going to take that and implement it in either a testing methodology. One could be more verbose or the other more educational, the other more technical. There could be different flavors of these methodologies, but also for tools. Also by writing it down like this you could have more tool supports. Even if this rule may not be fully automatible maybe tools can do different parts of these checks. For instance, to check that certain attributes exist, a tool can do that. But you may need to point out to the tool or support the tool to understand what the references are. By writing down the exact testing, first of all, we achieve a more common understanding and more consistency in the results but also allow for more tool support to take place, to have more scalability basically. Moving down in the rule, again these validation tests, these are the test cases that’s really important. Here you have some test cases and some examples of code that should pass. Some that are expected to fail. And some that are expected to be not applicable. That’s what’s your result is. When you run your methodology or you run your tool on these test cases, that’s the results that you should be expecting. I want to also show just two other rules that are in development because they are more related to manual testing. This is just an early draft. You can see from GitHub it is still only an issue. It is not even a so called pull request yet. It is the earlier stage of development. I am looking now at the keyboard trap R1 which is in the slides, the URL with issue 67 at the end. This one actually we have been working on that through the WAI-Tools Project. This is actually derived from the methodology that is used by the Norwegian Government agency called Difi who are also on the call today. They have a check in checking the keyboard trap. In their methodology they lead the evaluator from one step to the other what they need to do. And we extracted from that the actual essence of the check. The applicability and expectation. While doing that we saw that we need to actually separate it in to two subrules, R1 and R2. This R1 only checks that you can actually move away from the element. Many people don’t remember the success criterion of that part. The success criterion for keyboard trap, something along the lines that you can move away using standard keyboard controls. That you can move away from an element that you have tabbed in to or moved in to using the standard keys. By the way, standard keys is not defined in the guidelines. Or the user is informed about how to move away. So this or there, this needed a second rule to map that. This first rule R1 checks the first part of the requirement, which is if you can move in to an element you can actually move out of the element again. We have put an initial definition of what these standard keys are and these are the escape key, tab key, shift tab and enter key. This will be for discussion but the idea here we started to define this more specifically. What does it mean to move out using standard keys which is not really specified in WCAG at this moment. And then R2, as I said earlier R2 covers that or part of that success criterion of that requirement which is that help information is available. There are certain expectations again mapped in to how help information can be made available if you cannot use these standard keys. This is what we call a rule group. You have to combine in order to check the success criteria. There are two different kinds of subchecks in there or two atomic pieces. These were some examples of these ACT rules to give you an idea of how these ACT Rules look like. The important part here is that this is really geared towards developers of methodologies, not directly at evaluators. Then, what I have mentioned earlier, is the ACT Review Process. We saw those two rules, actually three rules but, you know, two sets and one looked finished. We just wanted to show the first one with the ACT R2, we wanted to show how it would look like when it is done, when it has completed this entire review process. The keyboard ones we have looked at most recently which is step 1 which is the creation stage. Step 2 is the validation stage which you make sure you have the test cases and in the right format. So, for instance, these keyboard tests right now they don’t have all the test cases that they should have. That’s why they are still considered in step 1. When they have all test cases and all pieces that they need, then they would then pass the validation stage. Then comes the verification stage where people debate and discuss. For instance, this definition that we have of what standard keys are. Somebody may challenge that or maybe somebody will request that another key combination get added. These are different kinds of things that need to get agreed on. Step 4 is the implementation of these rules. Every rule needs to have at least two independent implementations before it can even be considered by the Working Group for acceptance. This is how we try to do this work in the community process, outside the Working Group, so that we are more scaleable. We do that work through community development and demonstrate that these rules are broadly accepted and agreed on, and there are implementations for them. Step 5 is put in brackets because it is not really a step. This is actually an ongoing thing, the maintenance. At any time there could be new technologies, any reason why you would need to change a rule or maybe deprecate it or maybe there was a bug in it or things like this. There is this maintenance aspect in this review process. Last but not least, when there is acceptance and sufficient consensus, it may get accepted by the Working Group in to the ACT Rules repository as a completed ACT Rule that is ready for broader use. Moving on to slide No. 14, we have the same diagram again that we had earlier. Hopefully this will actually make a little bit more sense now, this diagram. Again, at the very bottom is ACT Rules Format which is the basis, defines what belongs in rules and how these rules should look like and this is out for draft. We are asking for your input on this and also review process, also this is for discussion. This also something we would like to have input on. On the side it is written ACT Task Force. This ACT Rules Format is what is standardized and developed by the W3C Working Group. The rules contribution and the rules review and processing really happens in a community group outside the W3C. Right now it is the Auto-WCAG community group. That’s the community group that we have. But there is no reason not to have others. For instance, there could be a community group focusing only on rules for digital publishing let’s say or we were for a while debating whether we needed to have a manual-WCAG group or have both in the same group side by side which is kind of what we are leaning in to. The layer above that is implementations. We start to have implementation already during the review process. We hope when you release rules in to repository that will get more implementations of this. Last but not least at the very top are the evaluators who use the implementations to come to a conclusion. Let’s just continue to slide No. 15. I want to emphasize the auto-WCAG group, since it is a community group, is open to anyone who wants to participate. We do ask you do get involved if you want to create rules, if you want to contribute. For instance, if you have ideas on the keyboard rule that’s being developed, well, chime in. Put in your comments. Put in your issues. Let us know what your thoughts are, or if you want to implement these rules and we will have a look at these repositories in a bit. The URL is there but I’ll also show you later on. Questions from the Survey Shadi Abou-Zahra: I’ll start by looking at some questions that we got from the survey. Unfortunately there were not as many as we were hoping. Many of you actually it seemed like wanted to know more about the ACT work and what it is which is why we have kind of switched more to introductory mode and to have more kind of background explanation. There were some interesting questions and I wanted to cover some of these. So some of the questions revolved around the idea of, you know, accessibility evaluation cannot be completely formalized or you cannot have, you know, to what degree can you make it so mechanical. One comment was even saying accessibility will get boring if everything was completely formalized and mechanical. Absolutely. There are key limitations. There are many things that cannot be tested automatically or even formalized, but what we are trying to do here is to document what we already know. To get agreement on some of the things like keyboard trap or things like headings hierarchy. There are several parts I think in WCAG where we can just document having a common understanding of and move on. There will be actually quite a couple of things still open. The next question actually also relates to that very much is kind of, you know, we are looking here at ACT Rules on an element level or very atomic level of issues. But very often issues are kind of in combination or in context. There is a big picture, what if you are dealing with an entire component rather than bits and pieces. That’s another limitation of this ACT work. This is another thing where evaluators will probably need to bring things together. Aggregate some thoughts like, you know, this keyboard thing is happening on navigation or versus it is happening somewhere else. What is the failure here. That’s the issue. There aren’t many things here that ACT does not fully address, but at least again we would have common understanding for some of these atomic level things. Some other questions where well, there is limited set here in repository. Not a lot to see. That is yes, just, you know, chicken or egg. We are just starting to develop some of these things. We do hope that we will see the commitments from some organizations. We have this European funded project that will support the development of these rules. We hope that in the next while once these pieces start firming up, that we will see the development of more rules here and this repository will get fuller as we go along. Some of the other questions that I liked about the usability of these ACT Rules. I would like to filter them. I would like to have them integrated with other resources. I would like to be able to use them more directly as a developer. This is also something that we are looking in to. I mentioned earlier we have the WCAG EM, evaluation methodology. We have the How To Meet WCAG 2 Quick Reference Guide. So there are several bits and pieces where we can tie together these things and have these rules appear in these tools and resources that the evaluators use more directly. Have them appear there, but first we need to have this repository kind of more rules in order to start connecting some of these thoughts. Let’s see, what else? What is out of scope of ACT? That’s a really great question. There are a lot of things that are out of scope. We talked about the limitations, just a little bit earlier. ACT really tests on an atomic level, on a very detailed level. It misses out a lot on the kind of grand scheme of things. More importantly ACT, one of the things that we really tried to or one of our important limitations is that we will not try in any way to redefine the requirements of. So that’s really important. We are not trying to extend or change or modify the requirements of a Working Group. That’s completely out of scope to try to define new requirements here. There were a few others but I think I will go to the queue and I will actually start opening up and have some discussion. If people don’t get on the speaker queue, then I will actually maybe call on some people. Wilco and Mary Jo, can I ask you both to unmute and if you wanted to add anything or to respond to some of the questions. Questions from the Floor Wilco Fiers: So to anybody who is not familiar, I’m Wilco. I work for Deque Systems. Thank you, Shadi, for putting this all together and for the presentation. It has been very helpful. The thing I want to emphasize most again is what I’m hoping to accomplish with this work is that we can start to harmonize our efforts. There is a lot of work going on in a lot of different organizations. And we are duplicate on a lot of stuff. So and all of that just means not just extra work. It means that differences are going to arise. People are going to see these differences. People are going to be confused about why does organization A say one thing and organization B say a different thing. And that costs us things. We lose people if they start getting confused about accessibility and really getting a clear message helps all of us. So that I think that’s really the essence of what I’m trying to get at, what I am hoping to get at with this kind of work. Mary Jo Mueller: I’m Mary Jo Mueller and I’m with IBM. I am the accessibility programs manager. I think that pretty much everything has been said about what our real ultimate goals are. It is important that there is a very consistent resulting message with tools doing testing. That they kind of agree upon their results. And then there is no questions that arise as far as who is right or what is exactly right with the test for accessibility barriers, what are the real accessibility barriers. And we get a nice consistent way to test for conformance which we need to report for our products. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Okay. Thank you both. So let’s see, some questions from the floor. So, first of all, Mark asks what does failure of a rule mean. Does it mean that a certain particular technique does not meet the success criteria or that the success criteria is violated. So the design of ACT Rules goes directly to success criteria. We don’t test techniques. But we actually test directly for the success criteria. So a rule maps to a failure. So basically you could think of it as a more elaborate failure. There are existing WCAG failures but we need more. Failures are sometimes also more general, like failure to provide text alternative or something general. We are breaking down these failure conditions in to more atomic and more specific bits and pieces, but if there is a failure of a rule, then actually that would map directly to a failure of at least a success criteria. Sometimes it may map to more than one success criteria. Wendy asks have we looked at the results format at the Sirus oasis. Yes. We are planning to continue using EARL which Wendy, you have been involved in creating. I would be interested to hear more of your thoughts, whether you think that there is a particular benefit of Sirus. We start to use JSON realization of EARL. Wendy Chisholm: My name is Wendy Chishom. Nice to see the reference there. Thank you. Some of our tools are not accessibility tools. And so we are looking for some formats so we can use between policy areas and looking for something that is more generic and so no decisions have been made. We are looking at some formats right now, Sirus, that is something that has been talked about recently. I am curious if others feel that also or if EARL is broad enough. One of the issues that we are having and it is funny, I haven’t looked at EARL in a while and I need to go back and look at it again, Sirus doesn’t have the breadth of fields that we are capturing, screen shots. Something we are investigating now. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Okay. Would love to hear more of your thoughts. I think GitHub, there is already this JSON realization of the role, trying to use I think we will take back that idea of revisiting Sirus and seeing if there are any particular things that it provides or benefits over EARL, but if you have any thoughts, let’s each look at what we haven’t looked at in awhile and see if we can come up with anything. Wendy Chisholm: Yes, if you have done a gap analysis or planning to, that would be interesting. Shadi Abou-Zahra: I will take a look. Next question is from Brian. Brian, do you want to introduce your question yourself? Brian Bors: I’m Brian. I work for the Accessibility Foundation. I’m part of the European projects. And we are dedicated to making these rules. And I was interested in how such a manual implementation of a rule would look like and automated implementation would be a tool that actually tests this rule, that have bound and manual implementation would look like. For us as an organization stating yes, we use this rule. Would that be enough or would you have to provide a few steps that our evaluators are following? Shadi Abou-Zahra: That’s a very important question. So with implementation in order to verify that there are implementations it would need to be publicly documented. And there are a few, there is the I mentioned earlier the Norwegian indicators by the Norwegian Government agency which are on GitHub and have done the work of translating them in to English. I don’t know if anybody from Difi wants to say something on that. There is also the Trusted Tester methodology which is publicly documented which you can have a look at and shows how to follow certain steps in order to check requirements. And they actually provide additional information, like which tools to use and which widgets or browsers. What to do in the browser to test a certain thing. And again I wonder if anybody from Trusted Tester wants to say any more on this. There is also the French RGAA which is also publicly documented on GitHub. This is the French Government approach for the same thing. And this is actually one of the things that we hope that we will get convergence between all these different approaches that are trying to do the same thing which is how to check something. Of course, again they could have their own flavors. So some are like in Excel sheets where they give you the step by step. And you have to answer a question first. And then based on that answer, you know, another kind of question pops up. And it is more like wizard kind of interface. Others could be maybe more just checklist oriented and so on. So I don’t know if that answers your question, but this is how implementation would look like. It would not be just taking these rules but really how you explain to a tester how they do that. Again this could be more technical. Or it could be more educational. Brian Bors: So like an instruction manual for a tester? Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, yeah. Again this instructional manual can be more educational if you are dealing with public sector bodies who, you know, are not the expert. It could be more technical if you are using that in your organization. And you are addressing more the QA testers. I think this manuals would look very different from one to the other. Brian Bors: Yes. That answers my question. Thank you. Shadi Abou-Zahra: All right. And Kathy writes on IRC just related to that the trusted tester is being updated now to include WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA and still in progress. Wilco Fiers: Right. Just real brief. I wanted to add that just to avoid confusion, the rules format is not about an applet. However you express your data be it in some sort of serializible format like EARL or Sirus or whatever you are using, a plain Word document, I think that many still do, just you write your report. It doesn’t matter. The ACT Rules Format is really about making sure that results are consistent. About having a procedure that you follow to ensure consistency across different tests and across different organizations. So then how you express those results, that’s the second question, that’s a separate question. There are some references to EARL in the ACT Rules Format simply because you can’t talk about accessibility testing without saying okay, this is a pass and this is a fail. And we need to say that in one way or another. But the serializible format that you express those results in are not part of the rules format. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Great. Thanks, Wilco. Let’s move on to the next question. Antonio says on IRC in chat, I’m very interested in understandable principle not only from a formal point of view. He goes on to ask accessibility content is less covered by WCAG 2, even in WCAG 2.1. Would like to contribute at this level in writing ACT rules. And the answer is as earlier said one of the clear limitations here we are not trying to define here any additional requirements. That’s a whole different beast to actually come to agreement on what is actually an accessibility requirement. We leave that exercise to the Working Group itself, which is having a lot of fun with that. If you want to get involved in that we do need all the hands that we can get on deck. There is a cognitive accessibility task force. There is a lot of work going on there. There is a lot of complexity of why this is so difficult to put some of these requirements in to testable statements. From an ACT perspective what we have agreed on is that there will be so called the conformance tests, these are what absolutely meet WCAG and then best practices. We have agreed to have best practices. So we know that a lot of things kind of pass conformance but are really ugly and really bad practice. So yeah, we could have rules that say hey, you know, this technically passes the requirements but it is still a warning or a bad practice or something. So we could have these kinds of rules. We are trying to focus right now obviously more on the more low hanging fruit just to demonstrate and get this snowball rolling first, that’s our first priority. We can do some of this work as so called best practices. Later on I think a lot of the cognitive aspects are also addressed by techniques and how can create things in good practice. So we can have rules for that. But we do not intend here with ACT to define any additional requirements. I think that also answers Jennifer’s support for Antonio’s comment here of the relationship between ACT rules and additional WCAG requirements. Charles says from the discussion possibility of a percentage outcome or other model in addition to simple pass/fail outcome. Here this is a recurring issue as well of so called metrics. Measuring accessibility and it would be so great to have, you know, to say this website is X percent accessible. But we couldn’t really come up with that means. We meaning W3C, we looked at this before, I will put an IRC and link for those who are not on IRC. It is W3.org/wai/2011/metrics. And so years and years ago in 2011 we held an online symposium like this one, only it was longer and we had people actually submit position papers on how they actually do some metrics calculations, how they come up with measuring the state of a website. We came to the conclusion that until today that’s valid, we haven’t found a single widely accepted process for doing that. There are a number of different approaches be it in Germany. There is an approach that is being used by the BITV Test and the idea of Barrier Walkthrough developed by Georgio Brajnik and others. There is several attempts but they have become so complex to calculate or a measurement that doesn’t reflect the accessibility requirements anymore. We have come up with four, I believe four requirements. I can’t remember them. Accuracy, sensitivity, complexity and there was another four dimension maybe to measure how qualitative a metric is and we haven’t found any that meet all these requirements. Thank you, Glenda. Thank you. Validity, reliability, complexity and sensitivity. And if you are trying to come up with how to measure the state of a website, you should try to address these like how valid is really the metric. How reliable it is and so on. This is also another piece that is out of scope of the ACT work. I know this comes very often in relation to testing and evaluation is having some percentage or some outcome. So far the WCAG model is pass/fail. And this is what we are using in ACT as well. The whole idea of aggregation and coming up with a final number, that’s out of scope of ACT work. And something that I think that continues to be very interesting research work here. And maybe Charles, you are involved in some of that, maybe Silver is the exploration for the new generation guidelines, 3.0 maybe that was, you know, maybe that will be a different model there. Daniel Montalvo: I’m Daniel Montalvo, working in a group of ONCE in Spain as an accessibility coordinator. My question is, you know, whether or not you are thinking in this scope of the ACT project to incorporate some of the assistive technology behavior once we can conclude the rules have passed. And I gave you the example of the ARIA described by attributes. I think something could be done to document, you know, the screen behaviors and the fact that they are described, value is or going to be held after the accessible main because it computes as accessible description. The same could be said, for example, if you are going to create rules about the title attribute and so on and so forth. I don’t know if you are thinking about that or something out of scope or what are your thoughts about it. Wilco Fiers: I knew it was coming my way. So the answer is yes, but only to a minimal extent. So what we couldn’t really do as part of ACT rules is specific documentation of things that may not work. Right? So we can’t explicitly say screen reader X doesn’t support Y. Because they may contest that. There may be different things that are disabled by default. There may be bugs. There is all sorts of gaps and difficulties that come up with your work as accessibility supports and that’s kind of what this is about. This is an accessibility support question. How much of this is supported in different assistive technologies. What is part of the ACT Rule is a section on accessibility support as part of every rule where it may be necessary that you document hey, we know there are assistive technologies that have some limitations. So you could in a rule where there are known gaps in assistive technologies you could add that information in. Say hey, as of the writing you know there are some limitations of certain assistive technologies without going in to high level of detail what those are and make that notes. Where it then continues and the reason why we put that section in we hope this will encourage organizations that actually do the limitation. So to developers, so accessibility agencies to take that information and run with it, to do some of their own testing to make sure that that information is then exposed to their clients to their users. So we did pick this up as one of the things that we are trying to encourage, but we can’t explicitly add that in to a rule because then you are essentially hard coding bugs in to documents which hopefully should live much longer than the bugs. So I’m hoping that kind of answers that question. Daniel Montavlo: Yes. It does. I mean the accessibility and I was going to ask but you already mentioned. So thank you. I was going to ask about what your expectations, not just from your host, but from the way in which the other organizations are going to use that and you have pretty much answered me. So thank you very much. Wilco Fiers: And I know that different organizations are looking at this. Some of them more explicitly than others. And it probably is a thing that the accessibility community as a whole has been kind of ignoring and thinking not being too sure about what to do with that. But I’m hoping by putting it in to the rules format that we do encourage people to start thinking about it more often because I think we do have a rather long way to go before we can do accessibility support properly. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Thanks. We also have Kathy. Kathy, do you want to speak up or maybe introduce yourself and some of the work that you are doing if you want to answer your question? Okay. I’m not hearing anything. I am not sure if your audio works. Kathy writes I am curious how automated would be one set of ACT Rules. Now so we actually started off with the idea of having rules that are categorized, let’s say automated and then other, semi automated and others that are manual. And then maybe with time as we have more Artificial Intelligence, and, you know, more advanced tooling and so on that some of these will wander off from being automated to semi automated or semi automated to automated. I came to the conclusion that it doesn’t make any sense at all in my head anymore. I think that’s a common for the rest of the Working Group is also at this stage. But this is where I am. And we actually move away from this categorization of automated, semi automated and manual because the intersection is just so strong. So let’s say this keyboard one, this rule that we looked at, well, you know, maybe rules will start showing you some of the components. Maybe they will be able to test the let’s say native components, native form fields but they can’t do that in things that are developed through JavaScript or something. So maybe you will have certain limitations. Maybe the tools can do five of the eight tests and then three others the developer has to do manually or evaluators. We are not planning to differentiate anymore or to say this has to be done manually or this has to be done automatically but maybe provide here the applicability and expectations. This was one of the major changes between the previous draft and this draft is to make that shift to applicability and expectations that describe what the outcomes will be, not really how to do it and let whatever can be tool support be tool support. And whatever needs to be done manually and that also may be the difference between one methodology and the other. The question that we had earlier about how do these different implementations look like. Maybe one methodology, you know, involves the use of tools that will do more semi automated checking while the other methodology that is more manual of that’s a matter of taste and flavor. But this is where the methodology developers, this is where you people, where you take these rules and interpret them in to your methodologies or tools. They are not intended directly to the evaluator. I am seeing some agreement. Glenda, you have been so patient. Why don’t you go ahead. Glenda Sims: I wanted to voice my support for the actuals and as a person working at Deque leading the accessibility experts there, we have more than 50 without our internal description of what is a failure and what’s not, I’ll get inconsistencies. That’s how I have got to consistency at Deque. I have put a lot of work in that. But if we want accessibility to move forward and to be attainable and easy and sustainable by people that haven’t done accessibility for ten plus years this is exactly what you need. So I’m thrilled about this. I can’t wait to contribute to it. Because it is just going to make those areas of WCAG that are more complex and nuanced to understand more attainables for everyone and with that being on that merry go round of is this a failure or not. I’m delighted and very supportive. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Great. Thank you. And you had some comments on the categorization as well. Glenda Sims: Absolutely. Absolutely. So when I heard you say that originally you had listed whether this rule was better suited, actually better suit for automated or was it something that you would expect semi automation or something you are like you know, the only way we can think of it today is manual, I do see value in that. But I get where it may not be in scope in this first round. Sounded to me as you were talking about that first round is let’s agree on defining how you test the accessibility test rule. And then you swing that through perhaps an update from an efficiency standpoint because knowing there are some people that I’ll walk up to and they will test something and they will be doing it manually where there is a tool that could have done it for them in under a second. That’s wasted time. So I see that that categorization while tricky to maintain its accuracy for is filled just manual, will be excellent for research for efficiency purposes. Wilco Fiers: Just to add on a discussion. It was a painful thing to drop the categorization to me personally but we didn’t entirely drop. So what is the proposal is that instead of making it part of a rule and saying this rule is automated, this rule is not, what we are going to do we are going to track to implement the rule because we need to know that anyway because when you are when you want a certain number of implementations before a rule gets published and as part of that process tracking who implemented was it automatically, was it manual and that way we still get that data. But it might be different for different organizations. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, thanks for this clarification. Good point actually. I didn’t talk much about that because we are not there yet but we do actually hope to have implementers declare not only which check they implement but also which individual test cases and how, whether they do that automatically or manually or whatever. And this will first give people an overview of which methodologies they can use for which purposes. But it would also I think also give us an understanding of where in researchers where there is more room for automation and work here. Charu Phandi: Hi. This is Charu. I also work for IBM accessibility research. And I wanted to say this is an excellent effort. Thank you, Shadi, Wilco, Mary Jo for leading this. I think it is much needed because the interpretation of the WCAG is so subjective and, you know, it leads to inconsistency in the validation from organization to organization. I think this effort will really help harmonizing all that and also save all the duplication. Like, Wilco, you mentioned each organization is doing their own thing and they have so much not only consistency but duplication. I’m so glad. And hope to contribute more. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Yeah, thank you. And all the participants in this work. This is a group effort of an entire task force and the invitation here for everyone to get involved. You can get involved either if you want to develop more of the specific area of the work, the rules format and the review process or if you want to get in to writing rules or commenting on rules I will provide again the links toward the end. We are actually starting to close. So if you want to say any final words now is the time to get on queue because we are kind of going towards the end here. Daniel Montavlo: Yep. As I said in the IRC just I saw those references to the different abilities that user profile should in order to be able to perform these kind of semi automated testings or manual testings. In fact, there is the confirmation for the evaluators to actually confirm that the role has passed or not. Have you dropped this already as kind of dropped the automated and semi automated thing or not? Shadi Abou-Zahra: Wilco, do you want to take that? In auto-WCAG there is information on user profiles. I think the answer is that this is outdated because the auto-WCAG is following on from what has been defined from ACT, but can you confirm that? Wilco Fiers: Yeah. The auto-WCAG rules while like Shadi said latest drop got updated less than a week ago. We are dragging a bit and it will take time to update the rules. User profiles, I’m not sure that we are going to keep this. I think that falls in line with the question of what do you actually automate or not. That may be more of a question for implementers than is something that should be part of the rule. But that is a discussion we haven’t had yet. I had a question. And the question was kind of for the rest of the group, especially people not involved in the work, and it is what, how could we help to let you contribute to the support. The more voices we have the better the quality and the more we use and are going to get out of this. Just a thought. Please jump on queue if you have anything to say. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Very good point. What can we do to help you get more involved. Brian actually asked a very good related question. He is trying to get some of his colleagues up to speed what does he need to give them basically. What do they need to know. What should they read. I will answer that question in the closing and give some pointers but as Wilco says this is by no means the answer. This is what we currently have. We know there is still a lot more help that we need to do. We know that a lot of these terminologies and groups and it is sometimes confusing. So your feedback will be very helpful. Also after the call feel free to send us your thoughts and comments and we will consider this as we go along. And your input is very valuable and very much needed. Katie Haritos-Shea: My name is Katie. I have been with the WCAG Working Group and at the W3C on various WAI groups as well as a representative for accessibility and other W3C Working Groups. But when Wilco first started this community group it was more than three years ago, wasn’t it? Like four? And everyone, this is obviously such a great idea. And, you know, it was a few people on Skype and besides watching the technology change, you know, at the W3C and somebody gets an idea and then it turns in to this real thing, some of them don’t make it and some of them do. But this is something that couldn’t make me happier being so much of my life having been involved with the development of WCAG 2 and working on WCAG 2.1. This is just something that is so needed. It has been needed. And for some reason had a hard time getting off the ground. But everyone who can please, please join this group. Either the Working Group or the community group. This is going to help all of us in our evaluations, in our work and are providing consistency really for the world and giving credibility to what accessibility is and how important it is and how it can be not something as contentious as somebody’s opinion. It doesn’t cover everything. We know that. But this is a very direct, organized way for competing companies to still be able to do what they can do but make sure that the outcome for users which is where, why this whole thing happens is going to be consistent. I don’t have any more time but I am thrilled. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Thank you for these words and we will contact you, but actually this question I wanted to pick up. I think, you know, several questions now are how can we get involved or get other people involved either as good, either get involved yourself or push others to getting involved and that’s fine as well. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and there is a lot of ways in which you can contribute. So let’s move on to wrapping up and closing and giving you some of the pointers, some of the information on how you can get involved. I agree with Louis, I know a lot of the W3C stuff is confusing and overwhelming in these different groups. Wrap-up and Closing So slide No. 19, just to wrap up again, a reminder the ACT rules format is out for public review. The link is in the slides but I’ll read it out. It is w3.org/tr/act-rules-format. And that’s the technical specification really defining how these rules look like. It also points to some of the exampled rules that we saw today. So this is really the basis for all this work. We hope that this will be our last as we are maturing on this. Please send your comments by the 5th of April on this. This is one way you can contribute is by sending your comments on this. Anybody can do that. The second is the auto-WCAG community group. This is as I said earlier a community group which is open to anyone. This is the place where rules are being developed. And in a community, so outside the Working Group. But if they follow this review process, demonstrate consensus and implementation, then these rules will essentially wander over to the W3C repository and become “formal” rules. The link is also in the slides. I will read it out. Auto-WCAG.GitHub.io/auto-WCAG. The auto WCAG group is open to anybody who wants to participate if you want to send comments on rules that are in development. If you want to develop rules, if you have ideas for rules that you’d like to develop, if you want to be involved in the development. So, you know, this keyboard rule that is being developed if you want to be involved in that development, if you want to implement such rule that’s really the place to interact. This is where the rules development will be happening. And then next is the ACT task force itself, which is part of the W3C Working Group and that’s where the rules format and the review process is being defined. So this is open to the W3 member organizations. In some cases we can have invited experts under very specific conditions. So but you can always comment all the work is being done in GitHub. You can always send comments and issues and the URL for this work is w3c.GitHub.io/WCAG-Act-rules. If you go there, Brian, that’s your question earlier, where do you send colleagues. We are trying to make that link, the last one that I just read out, that link really the place to go to. If you go to that link you will find some initial information and overview where the different bits and pieces are. We are going to be updating that page and providing more information, like the diagram that we showed today, maybe that helps also explain, put things in to perspective. So we will put a bit more information there. But that will be the place where you can send people. If anybody has further ideas of how we can provide more support, how we can help you or your colleagues get involved, do let us know. So these are the places where you can get involved. And if you have any questions, write me or us. I see Wilco already taking the names of people. And we’ll be reaching out to you as well in order to help you get involved. Good. I think we are coming towards the end of the call. Before we do that just, Wilco and Mary Jo, again any wrap up comments? Wilco Fiers: No. Just to say thank you very much to Shadi. I wouldn’t have had the time for doing this. Thank you very much. Mary Jo Mueller: Yeah, totally. Thank you for organizing this, Shadi. And I really do encourage folks to participate and contribute to our work. And we feel it is very important and it sounds like from you very important to you. So it all doesn’t come together unless we all work together to get it done. Shadi Abou-Zahra: Well, speaking about staying in the loop, so this online symposium here today was organized by the WAI-Tools Project, the EC funded project. A lot of thanks for that contribution. Without this, a lot of the work would not be possible. Through this project we are planning to do more such webinars, seminars, maybe also face to face meetings. We are looking at maybe in the fall in Germany a face to face meeting. There is also the ICT testing symposium in the fall where we may be doing or, you know, hoping to do a pre-conference workshop maybe. So we are going to be trying to do more kind of events in the coming period with the support of this so you can get more involved or get your colleagues more involved. If you do have more questions or ideas, also if you go to that Web page, there is a list that you can subscribe to a newsletter to get updates from that project. So you get informed, when we organize such an event through the project. So if you are interested in getting such newsletter update go to that Web page and subscribe. It is only when we have events or certain results from projects, things like that we send around. So we will be doing more of this stuff. Today was specifically focused on people who are doing manual evaluation and developing manual methodologies because we need to do more work here. We are really looking forward to hearing from you, hearing your thoughts how we can improve this work to better support you in developing your methodologies and making those consistent with the standards and interpretation worldwide. So let us know how we can help you in that mission. I want to thank everyone for all this work, in particular the working group participants, task force participants and people in the auto-WCAG. And all this work is done by the people in the groups. And you have heard how many people it takes to contribute to get this international consensus. So thank you, everyone. This concludes today’s symposium. And we’ll stay in touch and all the best for everyone. Thank you.",

    "title": "ACT Rules for Manual Web Accessibility Evaluation Methodologies – Online Symposium, 14 March 2018",
    "text": "Sponsors This online symposium was organized with support of the WAI-Tools Project , funded by the European Commission Invitation WAI-Tools Project invited developers of manual web accessibility evaluation methodologies, to participate in an online symposium on W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing (ACT) Rules, to: Learn about the W3C ACT Rules Exchange your perspectives Discuss ideas for improvement Get involved in W3C ACT effort This online symposium was held on 14 March 2018 at 14:00 to 16:00 UTC , free of charge. Background The W3C Accessibility Conformance Testing ACT Rules provide transparent and vetted checks for accessibility conformance of web content to the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). They are intended to help align conformance evaluation across accessibility testing tools and manual evaluation methodologies, to provide more reliability and trust. ACT Rules are contributed by volunteer organizations and individuals using the ACT Rules Format specification and following the ACT Review Process . However, these resources and processes are currently in development, with more input needed to refine them. In particular, more input is need to optimize the relevance of ACT Rules for manual evaluation methodologies. Objective The objective of this online symposium was to bring together developers of manual web accessibility evaluation methodologies, to explore the use of ACT Rules for their particular situation, and to invite participation this effort. Specific questions for this online symposium included: How do ACT Rules map to your evaluation procedures? What benefits are there for you in using ACT Rules? What challenges are there for you in using ACT Rules? Which modifications to the ACT Rules would help you? How likely are you willing to contribute ACT Rules? We asked interested participants to consider these questions in advance of the online symposium, and to share some of their thoughts with us through the registration form. This was to contribute to a more effective discussion and exchange of ideas. In particular, we were interested in your ideas on how we can improve the design of ACT Rules, including the ACT Rules Format specification and Review Process, to make them work better for your particular situation. Agenda Slides and Meeting Record are available. Logistics This online symposium used: Teleconference bridge with web-based and phone access; Live captioning of the discussion; Inter-Relay Chat (IRC) for additional interaction. Registration Registration is now closed. Please contact Shadi Abou-Zahra if you have questions. Contacts This online symposium was organized through the WAI-Tools Project, funded by the European Commission. Contact Shadi Abou-Zahra (Scientific Coordinator) with questions.",

    "text": "Page Contents Translation Assistance Welcome W3C Translation Policy Coordinating with W3C and WAI Priorities for Translating WAI Documents Translation Assistance Welcome We welcome your assistance translating documents developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). This page includes information on the W3C translation policy, how to coordinate with W3C and WAI when translating documents, and priorities for translations of WAI documents. Existing Translations A list of all WAI document translations is available from the W3C translations database. To get a list of WAI documents already translated in a specific language, use the advanced search and “Choose a language”, and under “Web Accessibility Documents” select – Any WAI Documents –. W3C Translation Policy Please read Translations at W3C for the overall policy, procedures, and support on translating W3C documents. More detailed information is available in W3C’s intellectual rights FAQ, particularly under the question can I translate one of your specifications into another language? There is also useful information in the section on W3C Documents in the FAQ, including the “can I change it?” question; the “is it official?” question, and the “can I annotate it?” question. It is also important to read the information on W3C document use. Authorized W3C Translations Most translations are informative and unofficial. In cases where standards translations are meant for official purposes, they may be developed as Authorized W3C Translations according to the Policy for Authorized W3C Translations. Generally only completed W3C Recommendations and Working Group Notes are candidates for Authorized W3C Translations, including the WAI guidelines, techniques, and other documents listed under “WAI Technical Activity” on the W3C Technical Reports and Publications page. The authorized translations policy is designed to ensure transparency and community accountability in the development of authorized translations under the oversight of W3C. Coordinating with W3C and WAI If you are translating a WAI document, please follow the instructions in the W3C Translations page on how to help translate a W3C document, and be sure to notify the w3c-translators@w3.org mailing list when you first plan to translate a document, and then again when you have finished a translation. You can also subscribe to the translations list and ask questions about translation on that list. If you have additional questions specifically related to WAI documents, you can contact us at wai@w3.org. Priorities for Translating WAI Documents People frequently ask us which WAI documents they should translate. Four lists are below: Top priority WCAG 2.0 materials High priority introductory and short materials Secondary priority introductory and short materials Secondary priority technical materials These lists are suggested priorities only. They are not meant to prevent people from translating documents for which they have a specific need. If you are interested in translating WAI documents that are not listed on this page or on the W3C Technical Reports page, please inquire first by contacting us at wai@w3.org. See the status information for each document. Some documents are available now, but will be updated soon. You might choose to provide a translation now, or wait until the document is updated.
